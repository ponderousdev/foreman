# ai/skills/universal/review/assets/round-push.sh's --against refuses a bare commit ID or a revision
# expression (Codex challenge round 2 / review round 1, confirmed: either
# is equally capable of asserting an arbitrary, deliberately-too-close
# ancestor with no binding to any actual branch). Every fixture below
# therefore marks its intended base with a frozen tag — never the live
# "main" branch name, which keeps moving as later commits land on it in
# these single-branch fixtures — and passes the TAG NAME to --against.
#
# ai/skills/universal/review/assets/round-push.sh also requires --closure-base, the exact SHA --against must
# resolve to, and now verifies every closure-resident input against that
# commit's own git objects (Codex review rounds 2 and current-head cloud
# review, confirmed). mark_base tags AT (default HEAD, so an earlier commit
# can be named for tests that need one) with `tag -f`, so calling it twice
# with the same LABEL just moves the tag rather than failing outright,
# extracts the closure from that same commit, and sets policy_args/
# scan_args as a side effect, plus the
# tag name and sha in mark_base_tag/mark_base_sha — MUST be called directly
# (never as `x="$(mark_base ...)"`), because bash always forks a subshell
# for command substitution, which would silently discard every one of
# those global-variable side effects the instant the subshell exits,
# leaving policy_args/scan_args/mark_base_tag/mark_base_sha stuck at
# whichever earlier fixture's mark_base call last set them directly (a
# latent bug in this suite itself, not in ai/skills/universal/review/assets/round-push.sh: caught only
# because two fixtures happen to give DIFFERENT, mutually exclusive
# docs_only_paths results, so a stale policy from an unrelated earlier
# fixture would misclassify rather than coincidentally agree — every
# fixture before that shared byte-identical closure content, so a stale
# policy_args was undetectably wrong).
