# lint-hygiene.sh — File hygiene checks (replaces pre-commit-hooks builtins).
#
# Checks: trailing whitespace, missing EOF newline, merge conflict markers,
# private key detection, mixed line endings, check-json, check-toml.
#
# Portable across macOS (bash 3.2, BSD grep) and Linux.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/lint-hygiene.sh [file ...]
#   If no files given, checks all tracked files.
#
# Per-file exemptions: an optional repo-root .lint-hygiene-ignore lists one
# path or glob per line ('#' comments and blank lines allowed); matching files
# are skipped entirely. Reserve it for app-managed configs the app rewrites on
# its own terms (e.g. karabiner.json dropping the final newline) — it is not a
# general lint escape hatch.
set -euo pipefail

# Binary detection below shells out to `file`. Without it that test silently
# never matches, so every tracked binary is scanned as text and reports bogus
# trailing-whitespace/EOF-newline failures — hundreds of them in a repo with
# committed assets, with nothing pointing at the real cause. Fail loudly here
# instead of degrading into noise.

    # gets pasted, and rendering strips markup — backticks, bold markers, link
    # brackets — and joins folded/wrapped lines, so any decoration between the
    # tokens can reconstruct the trigger. The scan is a BEST-EFFORT
    # approximation of the common accidental forms, deliberately not a

    # explicit chars). Prose words between the tokens — including non-ASCII
    # prose, which falls outside the gap class — never reconstruct and always
    # pass. A rare safe-but-flagged phrasing (e.g. a comma right between the
