#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-registry-drift.sh — the OFFLINE drift gate that binds label provisioning,
# provider wrappers, and Foreman adapter selectors to the machine-readable agent
# registry (agent-registry.json). Runs in `task verify` / `task ci` (ADR 0005
# D11: "later drift checks bind provisioning, wrappers, and the pinned upstream
# adapter roster to the same contract").
#
# The registry's SCHEMA and semantic invariants are the job of test-agent-registry.sh;
# this check adds the bindings between the registry and the things that consume it:
#
#   1. schema        — the registry still validates (fail fast before comparing).
#   2. label output  — the rendered suggest:/claim:/foreman: labels are exactly
#                      the family-level + provisionable set the registry implies
#                      (no agent:*, no seeded model-level, no non-production adapter).
#   3. provisioning  — setup-github-labels.sh renders those labels from the
#                      registry instead of hand-listing a forkable copy.
#   4. wrappers      — every claude-<family> provider wrapper maps to a
#                      provider-rewired harness registered in agent-registry.json.
#   5. adapters      — the provisionable Foreman adapters are internally coherent;
#                      the LIVE comparison against the pinned Foreman release is
#                      `task foreman:audit-adapters` (network — out of this gate).
#
# Dimensions 3 and 4 target files that only some render profiles ship
# (setup-github-labels.sh, claude-providers.sh); each is skipped, loudly, when
# its file is absent so the check passes across the whole render matrix.
#
# Every failure names the offending registry row / file and the remediation.
