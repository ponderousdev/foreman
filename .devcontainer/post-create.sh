# Ordering is load-bearing (AGENTS.md;
# https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init/tree/main/openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-05-bot-autonomy-bootstrap):
#   (i)   post-create-common.sh — workspace permissions and, on Coder, the
#         persistent-volume symlink setup MUST run before anything below
#         writes into those directories, or a write lands as the wrong owner
#         or into container-local storage the Coder block would later
#         disregard.
#   (ii)  ensure-antigravity-cli.sh — reconciles ~/.local/bin/agy-real and the
#         plain agy symlink from the rendered HARMON_BOT_AUTONOMY_ANTIGRAVITY
#         marker, before the bot-autonomy antigravity module acts on top of
#         whatever this leaves at ~/.local/bin/agy.
#   (iii) bot-autonomy.sh apply — every installed harness's bot policy, so a
#         fresh container's very first agent invocation already reflects it.
#   (iv)  the conductor step — spawns a `claude` process on first
#         registration, so it must not run before (iii) has succeeded.
#   (v)   bot-autonomy.sh verify — at the end of post-create, so a divergence
#         between what apply wrote and the harness's actual effective state
#         (e.g. an already-present workspace-level override) fails container
#         creation instead of surfacing only at the next post-start.

# the same check: mirror it, with a comment naming the twin, rather than
# reach across the boundary (see ensure-antigravity-cli.sh's
# discard_transaction and bot-autonomy/antigravity.sh's mirrored
