# This script controls two things about the env-file: which vars it INJECTS
# (from the host env, per the profile's allow-list) and which it EVICTS (strips
# when disallowed). The env-file is actively-managed runtime state, NOT user
# data — TS_AUTHKEY is evicted from the bot profile, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is always
# stripped — so this is secret hygiene, not a mutation of user-owned files (the
# values themselves live in 1Password; the env-file is only a projection). Vars
# the script does NOT recognize are left untouched, so a value an opted-out repo
# populates out-of-band (e.g. an app's own DEEPSEEK_API_KEY) survives rebuilds.
#
# The var sets are split by purpose, not merged into one:
#   BASE_MANAGED_VARS    — always-on secrets every profile may carry. These form
#                          the implicit default allow-list (the no-arg fallback)
#                          and are evicted when a profile disallows them.
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY    — recognized only to be stripped. It silently overrides
#                          CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, so it must never reach the
#                          container: never allow-listed, always evicted.
#   OPT_IN_PROVIDER_KEYS — alt-model keys (use_alternative_claude_providers).
#                          They are INJECTION-controlled only: an opted-in
#                          profile's initializeCommand passes them (so they're
#                          injected from the host env); an opted-out one doesn't
#                          (so they're never injected). They are deliberately NOT
#                          evicted when disallowed, so an opted-out repo that
#                          uses a same-named var as an unrelated application
#                          secret does NOT silently lose it on every rebuild. The
#                          load-bearing control is injection: a no-arg or
#                          opted-out invocation never writes paid opt-in
#                          credentials into a default-off repo's env-file, and a
#                          revoked opt-in stops injecting them. The trade-off is
#                          that a stale provider key already in the env-file when
#                          the opt-in is revoked is NOT auto-evicted — it lingers
#                          until cleared manually. That is a least-privilege nit,
#                          not a leak: the key stays safe in 1Password and the
#                          env-file is host-local and gitignored.
# FOREMAN_AGENT_GH_TOKEN is the separate READ-ONLY PAT foreman hands to
# dispatched agents as their GH_TOKEN (required before any dispatch); only
# the bot profile allow-lists it, so it is evicted from dev/ like GH_TOKEN.
# FOREMAN_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY / FOREMAN_KIMI_API_KEY / FOREMAN_GLM_API_KEY are
# credentials consumed by Foreman's OWN backend adapters (src/foreman/backend.py),
# distinct from the use_alternative_claude_providers wrapper keys below.
# FOREMAN_CODEX_MODEL is non-secret runner config (the codex-cli model pin);
# managed so a host-provided value flows into the env-file on Coder/Codespaces.
# All are bot-profile-only, so they are evicted from the dev profile like GH_TOKEN.
