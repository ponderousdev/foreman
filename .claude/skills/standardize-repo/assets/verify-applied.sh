# verify-applied.sh — validate a repo AFTER harmon-init conventions were applied.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-applied.sh [--ack-codeowner-change @old=@new]... [TARGET_DIR]
#   TARGET_DIR defaults to ".". Each acknowledgement must name one owner that
#   was actually dropped from main and one replacement present in the new file.
#
# Mirrors the validation philosophy of harmon-init's scripts/test-template.sh,
# but runs against an ALREADY-RENDERED, real repo (the result of `copier copy`
# / `copier update`), not a throwaway copier render. So it:
#   - delegates the heavy linting to the repo's own gate (`task verify`) instead
#     of re-implementing every linter, and
#   - spot-checks the structural invariants the template guarantees
#     (AGENTS.md canonical + agent-instruction symlinks, a parseable Taskfile,
#     no unrendered jinja markers, no leaked secrets).
#
# All checks accumulate; the script exits non-zero if ANY check fails, so it is
# safe to run as a post-apply gate in CI or locally.
#
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 (no mapfile, no grep -P, no associative arrays).

Usage:
  verify-applied.sh [--ack-codeowner-change @old=@new]... [TARGET_DIR]

The CODEOWNERS acknowledgement is intentionally exact: repeat it for each
intentional owner migration. The verifier rejects stale, extra, malformed, or
non-materialized mappings; there is no blanket access-control bypass.

# A Copier TEMPLATE repo's payload is not its own source, for the purpose of
# deciding which CAPABILITIES this repo implements. harmon-init ships
# `template/[% if include_terraform %]terraform[% endif %]/main.tf` — a file the
# GENERATED repo receives, not Terraform harmon-init lints — and counting it
# turns on the whole Terraform contract (lint tasks, provider-lock helper, a
# required terraform-verify) against a repo that rightly implements none of it.
# The payload root is whatever `copier.yml` declares as `_subdirectory`, so only
# a real template repo is affected.
#
# SCOPE: capability gating only. `repo_files` itself stays whole, because the
# payload IS authored code the template distributes — hiding it from the CodeQL
# matrix-drift check below would turn a security-coverage question ("is this
# language scanned?") into a blind spot.
# Expand Copier's `!include <glob>` documents in place. Copier splices the
# referenced files' documents into the manifest before merging; yq has no such
# tag and fails the whole merge on it ("cannot multiply !!map with !include"),
# which would drop the payload root for a perfectly valid template.
#
# Two details are taken from Copier's own loader (`_template.load_template_config`)
# rather than guessed: its `!include` constructor closes over the TOP-LEVEL
# manifest, so every nested glob resolves against that one directory, and it
# reuses the same loader class, so includes nest.
#
# DELIBERATE BOUNDARY: Copier globs with Python's `Path.glob`, which this cannot
# reproduce in portable shell — a quoted path containing spaces would be word
# split, and bash 3.2 has no `globstar` for `**`. Rather than half-match those,
# the expansion refuses them and the caller declines the exclusion with a
# diagnostic. Declining only over-reports a capability; guessing the wrong

# ── 4. No unrendered template markers leaked into the repo ──────────
# harmon-init uses CUSTOM jinja delimiters ([[ var ]], [% block %]). Legitimate
# look-alikes must NOT trip this: go-task uses {{.VAR}} (dot, no space), GitHub
# Actions uses ${{ }}, bash uses [[ -n "$x" ]] / array[idx], and terminfo uses
# \E[%p1%d — none of which have the "<delim><optional-ws-dash><space><token>"
# shape we match. We anchor variable markers on the copier answer-variable name
# stems (kept in sync with copier.yml; every question variable must be covered
# by one stem) so a real leak ([[ git_init ]], {{ author_full_name }}) is caught
# while bash bare-word tests ([[ true ]]) are not. Block markers anchor on the
# jinja keyword set, including the raw/endraw the template actually emits and the
# [%- whitespace-control form used in LICENSE.jinja.
#
# Enumerate files the way gitleaks (step 5) does — honoring .gitignore — so
# vendored dependencies in gitignored dirs cannot false-trip the scan: .venv
# ships Ansible's own .j2/jinja templates and plugin docs, .terraform caches
# provider source, node_modules is third-party. `git ls-files --cached --others
# --exclude-standard` lists tracked AND untracked-but-not-ignored files, so a
# freshly rendered, not-yet-staged repo is still fully checked. Fall back to a
# recursive grep (with explicit excludes) when the target is not a git work tree.

# ── 7. CODEOWNERS must not lose owners on adopt (access-control regression) ─
# CODEOWNERS is rendered from the single `code_owner` answer (`* @owner`), so a
# Path-B adopt over a repo with MORE owners (or a team) silently drops them — an
# access-control change that must be surfaced and confirmed, never auto-applied.
# harmon-init also freezes CODEOWNERS via _skip_if_exists; this is the belt to
# that suspenders (and catches a hand-overwritten CODEOWNERS too). Compare the
# @owners in the pre-adopt CODEOWNERS (on `main`) against the current one. An
# intentional migration is acknowledged only with an exact
# `--ack-codeowner-change @old=@new` mapping: @old must truly be dropped and
# @new must be present now. Extra/stale mappings fail, so this cannot become a
# blanket bypass. Skip cleanly only when there is no main or not a git tree.
