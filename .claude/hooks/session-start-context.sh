# session-start-context.sh — SessionStart hook (startup + compact matchers).
#
# Re-injects orienting context every time a Claude session starts or its
# context window is compacted: current branch, recent commits, working-tree
# status, open PRs/issues, local logins, and a short reminder of repo
# conventions. Uses `task status:git` + `task status:gh` + `task status:creds`
# (the fine-grained dashboard sections from scripts/status.sh) so the payload
# stays small and fast — `status:site` and `status:code` are intentionally
# skipped because they hit the network and the local build respectively, and
# `status:setup` because it is a network-heavy audit.

# The outer deadlines must exceed what the sections themselves allow, or the
# inner bounds are pointless: whatever the section was about to report is lost
# wholesale, because status.sh buffers each section before printing it.
#
# Each probe's worst case is its deadline PLUS status.sh's kill grace — the
# second run_timeout waits between SIGTERM and SIGKILL for a probe that ignores
# the first. Budgeting from the deadline alone understates every probe by that
# second, which was the whole of the margin these numbers used to carry.
#
# status:gh spends up to NETWORK_TIMEOUT (5s) on the auth probe and then up to
# another 5s on the PR/run probes it launches in parallel — 12s worst case with
# the grace, so 14 here. status:git makes no network calls at all.
#
# status:creds is budgeted from its own probes rather than by copying a
# neighbour's number: it runs three LOCAL probes back to back, each bounded at
# 3s inside status.sh, plus ONE bounded 3s call to read the gh token's SCOPES
# (a server-side property no local file records — issue #827), which is why it
# is capped at the local bound rather than NETWORK_TIMEOUT. Four probes, so
# 12s of deadlines plus four kill graces — 16s worst case, so 17 here for the
# `task` and shell startup around them. The three run in parallel, so it
# adds nothing to the wall clock the gh deadline already allows.
