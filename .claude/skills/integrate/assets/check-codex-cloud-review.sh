#      and never findings. Stop and report the blocker, naming the reset time
#      where the reply carried one. Both `reserve --attempt 2` AND a fresh
#      `--attempt 1` on the same head are refused — the one bounded
#      re-trigger must not be spent on a reviewer that already said no, and
#      there is deliberately no second same-head reservation route. So this

#   16 transient read — an evidence READ failed (harmon-devkit#508). Distinct
#      from 12/13, which mean the reviewer's window elapsed with no verdict:
#      nothing here says anything about the reviewer, so the caller retries
#      the READ rather than the reviewer cycle, and a gate maps it to
#      indeterminate-with-reason rather than to a not-clean failure.
#   17 not carried — `carry` only (harmon-init#752). The previously reviewed
#      clean verdict could not be shown to attest this head, so a fresh cycle
#      is required: reserve and trigger exactly as before. A normal negative
#      answer, never an error, and every fail-closed path in `carry` lands
#      here with its reason rather than on 2.
#   2  indeterminate — malformed, changed head, usage error, or a
#      current-head verdict whose shape cannot be classified
#
# 15, 16 and 17 are ADDITIONS: 0/10/11/12/13/14/2 keep their exact meanings, so
# a caller pinned to the older contract still reads every code it knew — and 17
# is reachable only from a subcommand that contract has never called.
#
# `settle` records the disposition of a finding that lives OUTSIDE an
# inline thread — a top-level conversation comment or a review body — because
# those two surfaces carry no reply linkage, so the in-thread adjudication path
# can never reach them and `check` would report `findings` for them forever.
# Its domain is everything `check` blocks on (`verdict_class == "findings"`),
# not only badged bodies: a body misread as a finding must stay answerable, or
# the misread strands the head instead of costing one recorded disposition.
#
# `reserve` creates the state a cycle runs on; `reap` is the other half of that
# lifecycle. Nothing else removes a state file — a shepherded PR is still open
# when its session stops, so a cycle can never reap its own state, and without
# a sweep the directory grows by one file per PR forever. `reap` exits 0 for a
# completed sweep whatever it found — kept and skipped entries are results, not
# failures, so a caller can run it unconditionally — and 2 only when it cannot
# complete a sweep at all (usage error, unusable root).

When --finder is given on reserve, actor identity and verdict classification
are driven by the finder's profile in the trusted registry (C1-C3).

`reserve` classifies each new cycle as charged or exempt against the two
ceilings (harmon-init#1326) and keeps the running totals in state as
`charged_cycles` / `exempt_cycles`. A cycle is exempt only when the previously
reviewed head is an ancestor of this one AND the new commits changed no file
the PR has under review — a base merge that re-reads identical code.
Everything else, including anything that cannot be established, is charged.

The previously reviewed head is taken from PERSISTED STATE, never from a
caller: a caller free to name any SHA could otherwise skip past a fix commit
and manufacture an exemption. `--previous-head` is therefore optional and
purely confirmatory — supply it to have the reservation refuse rather than
proceed if your idea of the last reviewed head disagrees with the record.

--integration-cap and --integration-exempt-cap make `reserve` REFUSE a cycle
that would exceed the ceiling it belongs to. A ceiling checked only by the
readiness gate is checked after the review has already run, since the trigger
is posted immediately after the reservation; this is the last point at which
the spend can still be prevented. Omit them and the reservation proceeds, with
the gate as the only backstop.

--run-id scopes the totals to one run. The state file outlives the run that
wrote it, so a second run against the same PR would otherwise inherit the
first run's spend; naming a different run starts the totals again.

`carry` (harmon-init#752) answers one question before a cycle is reserved:
does the previously reviewed clean verdict still attest THIS head? It does
when the head advanced by a base merge that left the reviewed change
byte-identical — the case a fresh cycle re-attests the same bytes at the cost
of a full reviewer window. Identity is a digest of the PR's own three-dot diff
TEXT, computed twice from IMMUTABLE commit SHAs: once for the reviewed head
against the base recorded for its verdict, once for the new head against the
base GitHub reports now. Equal ids carry the verdict; anything else, including
anything that cannot be established, requires a fresh cycle. It reads local git
only — no reconstruction of what a reviewer saw from the API — and writes no
GitHub state. (It is deliberately NOT `git patch-id`, which ignores hunk
offsets and collides on a relocated identical edit; see `change_identity`.)

A carry does not move the cycle. The state's head, trigger, request time and
settlements all stay exactly where they were; the record simply adds that this
cycle's verdict ALSO attests a later head. Everything downstream therefore
keeps working on the cycle it always worked on: `settle` still binds to the
commit a reviewer read, and `check` still runs the one evidence scan it always
ran — against that same cycle — so a finding landing on the reviewed head
after the carry blocks exactly as it would have without one. What the carry
removes is the second REVIEW, never the second look. Before reading evidence
`check` validates only the carry record's SHAPE; it re-derives the identity in
`emit`, immediately before any verdict, so no interval exists between the proof
and the answer it licenses.

  exit 0   carried: state now attests this head, no cycle was spent, and
           `check` will re-derive the same proof rather than trust the record.
  exit 17  not carried: reserve and trigger a cycle exactly as before. This is
           a normal negative answer, not an error, and every fail-closed path
           that leaves the PR open lands here with its reason.
  exit 14  the PR is MERGED or CLOSED: the stage is over. Stop — do not
           reserve, trigger, or poll.
  exit 2   usage error or unreadable state.

--repo-dir names the checkout `carry` (and a later `check` re-verifying it)
computes identities in; it defaults to the working directory. The identity is
taken between named commits and never against the index or the working tree,
so an unstaged edit cannot influence it.

`check` exits 0 clean, 10 findings, 11 pending, 12 retry, 13 escalate,
14 PR no longer open, 15 quota exhausted, 16 transient read,
2 indeterminate. Exit 15 is terminal for the HEAD, not just the cycle: no
same-head reservation is accepted afterwards, so recovery is a new commit or
an operator removing the state file (see #1115). Exit 14 means GitHub answered and
the PR is MERGED or CLOSED: terminal for the whole shepherd stage — stop,
never wait, re-run, or re-trigger. A PR fetch that FAILS is exit 16, a
transient READ failure — retry the read, not the reviewer cycle; only a
non-open answer is 14. Exit 15 means the finder answered that its review
quota is spent. It is terminal for the HEAD, not just the cycle: `reserve
--attempt 2` is refused, and so is a fresh `--attempt 1` on the same head, so
nothing re-reviews that commit through this helper. Recover by pushing a new
commit, or have an operator remove the cycle state file
(`git rev-parse --git-path integrate-codex/<owner>/<repo>/<n>.json`).
A safe recovery route is carried in #1115.
`reserve` and `attach` refuse a non-open PR outright,
exit 2 with a reason naming the reported state.

State locks are never reclaimed automatically. On lock-held, inspect the
reported PID and age; removing a lock directory is an explicit human recovery
action performed outside this helper.

# harmon-devkit#223: the timeout governing an attempt cycle used to live only
# in whatever `--timeout-min` a caller happened to pass, so `check
# --timeout-min 10` could return `retry` after ten minutes while the
# documented attempt-2 `reserve` — which takes no timeout of its own — was
# still enforcing the 15-minute default window for another five. The fix
# distinguishes ABSENCE (no command has ever chosen a timeout for this cycle)
# from a PERSISTED CHOICE (one has), and only the latter is authoritative:
#
#   - persisted is a number: that value governs. An explicit --timeout-min
#     that disagrees is a usage error (a second vote), not a silent switch.
#   - persisted is absent/null and --timeout-min was NOT passed: fall back to
#     the unmodified 15-minute default, unpersisted — still no choice made.
#   - persisted is absent/null and --timeout-min WAS passed: ADOPT it. This
#     is the documented convention itself — `reserve` (no flag) followed by
#     `check --timeout-min 10` must keep working, so the first explicit value
#     any command supplies for an otherwise-undecided cycle becomes that
#     cycle's timeout from here on. The caller persists the adoption
#     (`timeout_min_adopted=1` signals it must write `.timeout_min` back)
#     rather than this function, because writing state requires the caller's
#     already-held lock and read state file.
#
# Adopting is safe to do retroactively (not just before any `check` has run)
# because nothing about a `check` verdict is durable: every command
# re-derives `elapsed` from `requested_at` and `timeout_min` fresh, on its own
# invocation, against the real clock. There is no cached "attempt 1 timed
# out" decision anywhere in state for a later adoption to contradict — only
# `requested_at` (fixed at attachment) and `timeout_min` (this cycle's
# budget) are persisted, and adoption keeps those two mutually consistent for
# every command that reads them afterward. The one case that DOES get a
# second vote is two conflicting EXPLICIT flags — that is not absence
# resolving, it is genuine disagreement about the cycle's timeout, so it
# stays a `die`.
#
# `$1` is the raw `.timeout_min` from the state file: empty both for state
# written before this field existed (no key at all) and for a cycle that has
# never had an explicit choice adopted into it (the key is present as JSON
# `null`) — `jq -r '.timeout_min // empty'` collapses both to the empty
# string, and this function treats them identically, which is the point:

# harmon-init#752 — the change identity a carried verdict rests on.
#
# The PR's reviewed artifact is its three-dot diff (`base...head`), which is
# exactly what GitHub renders and what the cloud reviewer reads. Two heads
# whose three-dot diffs are the same text ARE the same change, so a verdict
# about one is a verdict about the other. That is the whole carry-forward
# argument, and it is why the mechanism is local git rather than an API
# reconstruction of what the reviewer saw: both inputs are immutable commit
# SHAs, and git answers from the object database.
#
# The identity is a digest of the CANONICAL DIFF TEXT, not `git patch-id`.
#
# Challenge round 1, finding `challenge-r1-codex-adversarial-1` (confirmed P1,
# REPRODUCED): `git patch-id` deliberately ignores hunk offsets, so it collides
# on a hunk RELOCATED between two regions whose context lines are identical —
# which is exactly what a conflict resolution can do to a reviewed edit. A
# fixture with two byte-identical stanzas produces two different trees and one
# patch id:
#
#     first-anchor  id: 0ebecfe39dfcd94a8b1e857f41c8bdd9d6d08cf3
#     second-anchor id: 0ebecfe39dfcd94a8b1e857f41c8bdd9d6d08cf3   trees equal? NO
#
# `--verbatim` does not help: it governs whitespace, not offsets. Nor does
# `--full-index`, which the earlier design leaned on — the two `index` lines
# above differ and the id is the same, so patch-id is not hashing them. The
# fix is not a better patch-id flag; it is to stop discarding information. The
# diff text already IS the canonical statement of the change, `@@` headers
# included, so hashing it verbatim is both simpler and strictly stronger.
#
# What the flags buy, none of them incidental:
#
#   `--unified=3`, `--no-renames`, `-c diff.algorithm=myers`,
#   `-c diff.indentHeuristic=true`, `-c diff.noprefix=false`,
#   `-c diff.mnemonicPrefix=false`, `-c diff.relative=false`,
#   `-c core.quotePath=true`, `-c diff.srcPrefix=a/`, `-c diff.dstPrefix=b/`,
#   `-c diff.interHunkContext=0`, `-c diff.suppressBlankEmpty=false`,
#   `-O/dev/null` — the knobs that make the same two trees render as different
#   text, pinned because this value is recorded once and re-derived later,
#   possibly in another checkout. Unpinned, drift produces a REFUSAL rather
#   than a false carry, but a refusal costs the cycle the mechanism exists to
#   save and misreports an unchanged change as moved.
#
#   Integration cycle 3 (claude), finding `integration-r3-claude-1` (confirmed
#   P2, REPRODUCED): this comment called the list exhaustive and it was not.
#   `diff.srcPrefix`/`diff.dstPrefix` survive `diff.noprefix=false`,
#   `diff.interHunkContext` fuses hunks and rewrites the `@@` headers,
#   `diff.suppressBlankEmpty` has no flag at all, and `diff.orderFile` reorders
#   the files (overridden by `-O/dev/null`; an EMPTY `diff.orderFile` makes git
#   fail outright). Each changed the hashed text on git 2.55; each is restored
#   by its pin; and all five pins are byte-identical to default output, so no
#   existing change id moves and `algorithm` keeps its `v1`.
#
#   `GIT_ATTR_SOURCE=<empty tree>`, `-c core.attributesFile=/dev/null` —
#   integration cycle 5 (claude), finding `integration-r5-claude-1`: that list
#   was closed over CONFIG KEYS, and attributes are the other input to
#   rendering. They are read from the WORKING TREE, not the commits diffed, so
#   the identity of two immutable SHAs depended on what was checked out.
#   Sourcing attributes from the empty tree removes both that and any
#   branch-shipped `.gitattributes`; `info/attributes` is refused above. On a
#   clean config this is byte-identical to default output. A git older than
#   2.40 ignores the variable: drift there costs a refusal, never a false carry.
#   That is the whole claim — closed over the config keys and attribute sources
#   git documents, not over every future one.
#
#   The `sed` that strips everything after a hunk header's closing `@@` —
#   integration cycle 5 (codex-cloud, attempt 2), finding
#   `integration-r5-codex-cloud-1` (confirmed P2, REPRODUCED): the text after
#   `@@ -a,b +c,d @@` is funcname CONTEXT, chosen by a driver's
#   `diff.<driver>.xfuncname`. Sourcing attributes from the empty tree removes
#   every named driver, but a file with none still uses git's built-in
#   default, and `diff.default.xfuncname` in config still rewrote its headers
#   (reproduced: `@@ … @@ body1` vs `@@ … @@ FUNC main`). No flag disables it,
#   so the representation drops it. Nothing about the change is lost: the
#   offsets, the context lines, and every changed line are kept, and funcname
#   is display text derived from the pre-image. Only a hunk header can start
#   `@@ -` — content lines carry a ` `/`+`/`-` prefix and binary-patch lines
#   a length letter. This moves the bytes `v1` hashes for any hunk with
#   funcname text; no release has shipped `v1`, so its definition is fixed
#   here rather than versioned.
#
#   `--no-ext-diff`, `--no-textconv` — a branch can ship `.gitattributes` and
#   the repository can carry config that routes a file through an external
#   diff driver or a textconv filter. Either would let branch-controlled code
#   decide what the "change" looks like, which is a trust boundary this must
#   not cross. Both are disabled.
#
#   `--binary`, `--full-index` — a binary edit must be visible rather than
#   collapsing to the constant text "Binary files ... differ".
#
#   `--ignore-submodules=none` — a submodule pointer move is a change to the
#   reviewed tree, and the default can hide it.
#
#   `--submodule=short` — integration cycle 3, finding
#   `integration-r3-codex-cloud-3` (confirmed P2, REPRODUCED): `diff.submodule`
#   is a display preference `--full-index` does not override. Under `log` a
#   pointer move renders as `Submodule sub 1111111...2222222`, seven hex digits
#   of each side, so two DIFFERENT pointer moves sharing those prefixes hashed
#   identically and a changed submodule inherited the earlier clean verdict.
#   `short` is the one format that prints both full gitlink IDs.
#
#   `--no-replace-objects` — challenge round 1, finding
#   `challenge-r1-codex-adversarial-5` (confirmed P2): `refs/replace` entries
#   are applied transparently by `cat-file`, `merge-base`, and `diff`, so a
#   checkout carrying one can make an immutable SHA resolve to a synthetic
#   commit — and both the carry and the later re-derivation would reproduce the
#   same synthetic proof. The immutability the whole argument rests on is a
#   property of the object database, so the one feature that overrides it is
#   turned off for every command in this path, and the deprecated grafts file
#   is refused outright since no flag disables it.
#
# Sets change_identity_value on success; change_identity_error and a non-zero
# return otherwise. Every failure is a refusal to prove identity, never a
# claim that the change differs — callers charge a fresh cycle on both.

# Codex cloud cycle 3, P1 (confirmed): classification used the last RESERVED
# head as "the last reviewed head". A cycle that never produced a verdict —
# pending, transient, quota-blocked, escalated — still left its head there, so
# the next reservation could exempt the first request that would actually
# produce a review. This PR demonstrated it: two cycles escalated with only a
# 👀, and their heads would have counted as reviewed.
#
# The marker is written HERE rather than at each terminal emit, because there
# are six of those and this change has already shipped that mistake four times:
# a fact recorded in one place cannot be forgotten at a call site.
#
# harmon-init#752: the marker also records WHICH verdict landed. The exemption
# classifier only ever needed "this head was reviewed", but a carried-forward
# verdict is a claim that a specific CLEAN result still attests a later head,
# so `clean` has to be distinguishable from `findings` here — nothing else on
# the state file distinguishes them.

# harmon-init#752 — does this cycle still attest the head the PR is at?
#
# Challenge round 3, finding `challenge-r3-codex-adversarial-1` (confirmed P1):
# the first version derived this once, up front, and then let a minutes-long
# evidence scan run before emitting a verdict. Every liveness check in that
# window compares the HEAD alone, so a PR retargeted to a different base — or a
# base branch force-pushed — changes the three-dot diff under an unchanged head
# and the verdict is about a diff that no longer exists. The identity is a
# function of (base, head), and both have to still hold at the moment the
# verdict is made.
#
# So it runs exactly once, immediately before the verdict, at the point that
# dominates every clean and findings exit. A pending exit reports no verdict,
# so it neither needs nor gets the proof. (Integration cycle 5 (claude),
# finding `integration-r5-claude-3`: this sentence said "clean/findings/pending"
# after `emit`'s hook became `clean | findings)` — the last of three sites.) Comparing the two fresh
# identities to EACH OTHER is not enough on its own either: that would confirm
# the change is self-consistent right now while saying nothing about whether it
# is still the change the carry was proved over, so a state file edited to name
# a different head would pass. Both fresh values are also compared against the
# recorded one.

          # praise — by rejecting caveat shapes, then by requiring a praise
          # word, then by requiring every word to be recognised. Each looked

          # ("Tests fail on Windows.", "Nice work, tests crash on Windows.",
          # ":warning:", "Work on it."). The clause is free text that Codex
          # writes differently every time; it is not a channel that can be
          # parsed reliably, and the allowlist that preceded those attempts
          # could not converge either — seven distinct clauses, three inside
          # twenty-five minutes, and it deadlocked the PR that was fixing it.
          #
          # So the tail is not load-bearing. What decides the verdict is the
          # part of Codex's output that does NOT vary:
          #
          #   1. the verdict sentence itself, matched exactly;
          #   2. the absence of any severity badge ANYWHERE in the body —
          #      every finding Codex has ever posted here carried one,
          #      including the observed P3;
          #   3. every remaining line being Codex's own metadata.
          #
          # Inline comments on the current head are classified as findings
          # separately, before this runs.
          #
          # The residual, stated plainly: a concern that is unbadged, absent
          # from the inline comments, and appended to a sentence that says the
          # opposite would pass. That has never been observed — it requires
          # Codex to contradict itself mid-line — and this gate promotes a
          # draft to ready-for-review rather than merging, so a human still
          # reads the PR. That is a better trade than a parser that has been
          # wrong three times.
          # Used only by the review-settlement gate in `check`, but defined
          # here so they share `body_text`, the About-block removal, and the
          # Reviewed-commit pattern with `verdict_class` instead of growing a
          # parallel set of regexes that could drift apart. A findings review's
          # body is a CARRIER: a heading, one fixed sentence, and Codex's own
          # metadata, with the findings themselves in the inline comments.
          # Anything else in it is prose nobody has answered.
          #
          # These defs work off `carrier_lines`, NOT `first_line`, because a
          # real findings-review body begins with a BLANK LINE:
          # "\n### 💡 Codex Review\n\n…" is what #355 and #273 actually posted.
          # `first_line` is therefore empty for every genuine findings review,
          # and a heading test built on it can never match one — the gate would
          # be permanently inert, re-blocking every PR and reproducing the #275
          # deadlock from the fail-closed side.
          #
          # `first_line` itself is deliberately LEFT ALONE. It serves
          # `verdict_class`'s clean-verdict prefix test, and clean results are
          # top-level comments that open directly with the verdict sentence —
          # a different payload shape from these review bodies, with no leading
          # blank observed. Loosening the shared def to fix a review-body
          # problem would change what counts as a clean verdict too, for no
          # evidence that the clean path needs it.
          #
          # The heading match is loose about what sits between the hashes and
          # the words — "### Codex Review" and "### 💡 Codex Review" have both
          # been observed — and strict about the words themselves.
          #
          # The sentence is pinned as the literal observed on
          # evanharmon1/harmon-devkit#355. Pinning cuts the other way from the
          # verdict-line clause deliberately: this is the SETTLED path, so a
          # reworded sentence fails to match, the review is not settled, and
          # the check re-blocks. Drift in Codex's format costs a false block,

# harmon-init#1326: classify a cycle as CHARGED or EXEMPT against the
# integration cap.
#
# The cap exists to bound how many times a reviewer is asked to look at work
# that changed. A cycle whose head differs from the last reviewed head ONLY by
# a base merge that touched nothing under review re-reads identical code by
# construction — it cannot find anything the previous cycle did not — so
# charging it measures the base branch's traffic rather than the change's
# difficulty.
#
# The test is deliberately narrow, and it is a set intersection rather than a
# judgement about merge commits:
#
#   exempt  <=>  previous_head is an ANCESTOR of head (the base was merged in,
#                nothing was rewritten), AND no file the PR has under review
#                appears among the files the new commits changed.
#
# "Under review" is computed from the CURRENT head, which is what makes the
# rule self-correcting rather than a loophole:
#   - a conflict resolution edits a file under review        -> intersects -> CHARGED
#   - the author slips a real fix into the merge push        -> that file is
#     under review at the new head                           -> intersects -> CHARGED
#   - a clean merge of base commits touching other files     -> disjoint    -> EXEMPT
#
# THE INVARIANT: exempt only on positive proof. Every other outcome charges.
#
# Challenge rounds 1-3 each found a different way to be wrong about this, and
# they all shared one shape — some input the classifier could not fully
# establish, treated as if it had been. So the rule is stated once here and
# every branch below obeys it: an uncertain compare, a truncated file list, a
# state file that does not belong to this run, an unreadable patch, an
# unexpected status — each charges. Under-exempting costs one cycle, which is
# exactly the status quo this change improves on and never worse than it.
# Over-exempting spends budget the reviewer never sanctioned, and no error in
# that direction is recoverable once the cycle is gone.

    # that history from one issue-comment read.
    #
    # The lower boundary for "same-head history" needs a timestamp GitHub
    # itself assigned, not one the committer wrote. Trigger comments carry no
    # head field, so harmon-devkit#1014's original version fell back to the
    # current commit's author/committer dates as a "conservative" boundary —
    # but those are client-controlled: a commit dated at or after a real
    # prior trigger hides that trigger from reconstruction entirely.
    #
    # The head's earliest check-suite `created_at` is server time,
    # un-spoofable by the committer — but challenge round 1 (2026-09-14,
    # confirmed harmon-devkit#1014 finding challenge-r1-codex-adversarial-1)
    # found that PREFERRING a check-run's `started_at` outright whenever any
    # check run exists — replacing the commit-date boundary rather than
    # combining the two — reopens the exact regression class this boundary
    # exists to close, via ordinary CI timing rather than a spoofed date.
    # Fixed with `min(commit-date boundary, earliest check-run started_at)`.
    #
    # Integration remediation 1 (2026-09-14, Codex cloud review on `a5bc99a`,
    # confirmed finding `4010207979`) found a COMBINED case that `min()` over
    # check-run `started_at` still does not close: when the commit dates are
    # ALSO future-dated (spoofed later than reality) AND a trusted trigger is
    # posted before CI has started its first RUN, `min()` still picks the
    # check-run boundary (since it is earlier than the inflated commit
    # dates) — but that boundary is itself later than the genuine trigger,
    # because a check RUN's `started_at` carries real CI-queue/startup
    # latency on top of when GitHub actually received the push. A check
    # SUITE (the envelope check runs belong to) is created essentially the
    # instant GitHub processes the push, before any run inside it has had a
    # chance to start — a tighter, still-unspoofable proxy for "when this
    # commit became the head" than any individual run's start time. Using
    # the earliest check-suite `created_at` instead of the earliest
    # check-run `started_at` closes this combined gap while keeping the same
    # `min()` structure (still defeats a plain commit-date spoof) and the
    # same fallback (commit dates alone, when no check suite exists at all).
    # `commit_date_boundary`/`check_suite_boundary` name both compared inputs
    # in state (the latter `null` when no check suite exists), and
    # `boundary_source` names only which one actually won the comparison — a
    # later reader can audit the comparison itself rather than trust a
    # single opaque label.
    #
    # KNOWN RESIDUAL (harmon-devkit#1030, Codex cycle 2 on `30b613c`,
    # confirmed finding `4010671547`, adjudicated P2 — a residual of the
    # timestamp approach itself, not a defect in this change): when the
    # commit dates are ALSO future-dated AND the trusted trigger is posted
    # before the first check SUITE exists (not merely before the first
    # run), every available lower bound — commit dates and check-suite
    # creation alike — postdates the trigger, so it is filtered out and
    # `requires_full_window` stays false. No further timestamp refinement
    # closes this: the trigger genuinely precedes every server-side signal
    # available at reconstruction time. #1030 tracks the structural fix —
    # on a reservation with no prior local state for the head, treat any
    # other trusted `@codex review` comment on the PR, posted after the
    # previous head's last accepted result (or, absent such a record, any
    # at all), as a prior trigger regardless of its timestamp ordering
    # against commit or check-suite creation.

    # reviewed. Two consequences, and they are the whole of it.
    #
    # First, two different heads are in play, and conflating them is how this
    # breaks:
    #
    #   $state_head          — the head of the CYCLE. Every EVIDENCE binding
    #                          keys off it: a `Reviewed commit:` line, a
    #                          settled comment's prefix, the receipt this cycle
    #                          emits. It is the head a reviewer actually read.
    #   $expected_live_head  — the head the PR is expected to be AT. Every
    #                          LIVENESS check keys off it. With no carry the
    #                          two are the same value and every check below
    #                          behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
    #
    # The distinction is named once, here, because there are three liveness
    # sites and the first draft of this patched one of them.
    #
    # Second, what is checked HERE is the RECORD'S SHAPE — a claim missing any
    # field the proof is re-derived from is malformed state, and there is no
    # point reading evidence under it. The IDENTITY itself is re-derived
    # elsewhere: in `emit`, immediately before any verdict, because rounds 3
    # and 4 each showed that a fixed point earlier than that leaves an interval
    # in which a retarget can land. See `verify_carried_attestation`.
    #
    # Integration cycle 2, finding `integration-r2-claude-4` (confirmed P3):
    # this comment still said the identity was re-derived here "before any
    # evidence is read", which round 4 made false and which contradicts the
    # comment on the post-hash re-read. These are where the trust argument is
    # written down, so two of them telling a reader opposite things about where
    # the boundary sits is a real defect, not a typo.
    #
    # Everything after this point is the ORDINARY cycle check: challenge round
    # 2 deleted the recursive re-check round 1 added, because re-checking the
    # cycle is not something this code needs to do when the cycle was never
    # copied in the first place.

    # Current-head inline findings are PARTITIONED, not counted

    # finding re-blocked every later check until a new commit moved the head,
    # which is the opposite of what the shepherd stage asks for — a finding is
    # settled by fixing it OR by declining it with reasoning in its thread.
    #
    # A bot inline comment on this head is ADJUDICATED when its own thread
    # carries a trusted reply posted after it. The replies come from the SAME
    # `pulls/<n>/comments` listing already fetched, because a reply to a review
    # comment IS an inline comment — it is the same resource with
    # `in_reply_to_id` set to the comment it answers. There is no second
    # endpoint to fetch and no GraphQL thread walk needed.
    #
    # Trust is `author_association` in {OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR} OR the
    # reply's immutable numeric user ID equalling the PR author's. The
    # association alone is not enough: a shepherd driving a fork PR replies as
    # the PR author with association CONTRIBUTOR, and refusing that would make
    # the contract unfinishable again for exactly the sessions this helper
    # exists to serve. The bot may never adjudicate itself.
    #
    # What a reply SAYS is deliberately not examined, and that is a knowingly
    # accepted residual: a content-free trusted reply — "looking into it" —
    # adjudicates the finding just as a reasoned decline does. Requiring an
    # explicit disposition would mean parsing reply prose for intent, which is
    # the exact failure family documented at length above `verdict_class`, and
    # issue #275's acceptance criterion is reply-from-a-trusted-actor, not
    # reply-content. It also matches what SKILL.md §2 already says about the
    # main thread check: it measures whether a thread has been answered, never
    # who thought about it. The cost is bounded because this gate promotes a
    # draft to ready-for-review rather than merging, so a human still reads the
    # disposition that now stands on the PR.
    #
    # Malformed or missing fields on a would-be trusted reply — no numeric user
    # ID, no association, an unparseable timestamp — make that reply untrusted,
    # so the comment stays UNADJUDICATED and the check reports `findings`. That
    # is the opposite of `verdict_class`, where unparseable means indeterminate,
    # and deliberately so: an unreadable verdict says nothing about whether the
    # PR is clean, but an unreadable reply is simply not proof that a human
    # answered the finding. Fail-closed here points at `findings`.
    #
    # The edited-since-reply rule compares the bot comment's `updated_at`
    # against the LATEST trusted reply's `created_at`. Codex edits a finding in
    # place when it revises it, and a reply that predates the edit answered
    # different text — so an edited comment whose replies are all older is
    # unresolved again. `updated_at` absent means never edited and falls back to
    # `created_at`; present but unparseable fails closed, like every other
    # malformed field here.
    #
    # That comparison is STRICT. GitHub timestamps are second-precision, so a
    # reply stamped the same second as an edit cannot prove it came after the
    # edit — and a tie resolved in the reply's favour would silently adjudicate
    # text the replier may never have seen. The never-edited case is unaffected:
    # `updated_at` then equals `created_at`, and a trusted reply is already
    # required to be strictly later than that.

    # The partition also records which REVIEW each finding belongs to, via the
    # inline comment's `pull_request_review_id`. A review is settled only by its
    # OWN findings — see the correlation comment above the review gate below.
    # A current-head bot inline comment carrying no numeric
    # `pull_request_review_id` cannot be attributed to anything, so it settles
    # nothing at all: the whole settled set collapses to empty rather than
    # letting an unattributable finding be counted against some other review.
    #
    # Review round 2, finding `review-r2-codex-verification-1` (confirmed P1):
    # this count and the partition below were TWO DOMAINS FOR ONE QUESTION.
    # Challenge round 5 (`challenge-r5-codex-adversarial-5`) taught the
    # partition to exempt a self-fix summary and left this count unfiltered,
    # so a head whose only actor inline comment was a self-report counted 1
    # here and produced an EMPTY bot set there: nothing was unadjudicated, so
    # `adjudicated_findings` was set, and the attribution assertion below —
    # which requires at least one attributed review — could never be satisfied.
    # The cycle exited 2 and handed a benign, informational state to a human,
    # while the same head with ZERO actor inline comments reached the ordinary
    # pending path. Reproduced as exactly that asymmetry (2 versus 11).
    #
    # In the merge base the two domains AGREED, because neither filtered. The
    # divergence was created by narrowing one of two coupled sites, which is
    # why the fix is one predicate rather than a second filter: the count now
    # asks the same `is_self_report` question every other consumer asks.

    # Each candidate is tagged with its `surface` (review/comment/reaction).
    # Ids from different GitHub resource types are not chronologically
    # comparable — a review id and a comment id are drawn from unrelated
    # sequences — so when the newest timestamp is shared by candidates from
    # more than one surface, that tie is unresolvable here and `tie:true`
    # says so (harmon-devkit#1014 ruling 4, Codex cycle-1 finding
    # `4007296539`); a same-surface tie is still broken by id, same as
    # before. The bash `tie` check below acts on this only once every
    # non-codex finder mode has already exited, so this flag never changes
    # CodeRabbit/Copilot behavior.
    #
    # Integration remediation 1 (2026-09-14, Codex cloud review on `a5bc99a`,
    # confirmed finding `4010207991`) found two compounding problems with the
    # tie exit as it stood: (1) a `settle`d review/comment is never excluded
    # from tie consideration, so once a human disposes of the finding behind
    # a cross-surface tie, the exact same tie recurs on every later check —
    # an immutable indeterminate result the settlement can never clear,
    # reopening the #275 deadlock class this file works hard everywhere else
    # to avoid; (2) a tie where one side carries an actual badged finding
    # exited indeterminate before the review/comment classifiers below ever
    # got a chance to surface it as `findings`, discarding a concrete result
    # in favor of a shrug.
    #
    # Fixed by tagging each candidate `disposed` (its id is in
    # `disposed_reviews`/`disposed_comments`) rather than dropping it from
    # the array outright: a disposed candidate is answered, not a live
    # contender for "which surface is newest," but it must still be able to
    # BE `newest_result` on its own — the pre-existing `disposed_applied`
    # terminal-clean exit further below depends on a solo disposed finding
    # (nothing else posted on this head) still resolving to its own
    # time/id, exactly as before this fix. So disposed candidates are
    # excluded only from the *diversity* check that decides whether a tie is
    # genuinely live (`$top_live`), never from the candidate pool itself:
    # when nothing live ties with it, a disposed candidate (or several

    # the summary-table verdict surface it replaces is carried in #1117).
    #
    # Rounds 1 to 3 each tried to bind a badged comment to a head by PARSING
    # its body, and each attempt reproduced a way to lose the badge: the
    # Completed-row arm, then the header-driven columns, then a guard that
    # asked whether the table named *any* commit when the question was whether
    # it named *this* one — and whose `indeterminate` exit was unsettleable by
    # construction, because it fired exactly when the binding it needed was
    # unavailable.
    #
    # Nothing here derives a head any more. The reservation already pins one
    # repo, one PR and one head, and the trigger already scopes the cycle, so a
    # badged comment from the pinned actor posted after that trigger is either
    # bound by its own `Reviewed commit` line — handled by the ordinary
    # candidate path below, with its GitHub-verified prefix resolve — or it is
    # not bound at all, and then it BLOCKS until a human settles it by comment
    # id. `settle` accepts exactly that shape (see its own comment), so the
    # block is always answerable: no parse, no unbindable class, and no way for
    # a badge to be silently dropped.
    #
    # Fail direction: a badged comment about some OTHER head that names no
    # commit also blocks here. That is one recorded disposition, which is the
    # cheap side of this trade — the expensive side is the false clean this
    # whole family of bugs produced.
    # Challenge round 4, findings `challenge-r4-codex-adversarial-1` and `-2`
    # (both confirmed P1). Two independent ways this scan dropped a live badge:
    #
    #   -1  It ended `sort_by(...) | last`, so only the NEWEST unbound badge
    #       was ever considered and the disposed check tested only that one.
    #       Settling the newest made every OLDER undisposed badge invisible —
    #       reproduced as exit 0 with a live unsettled P0. Every undisposed
    #       badge blocks now, and the OLDEST is cited so repeated settling
    #       walks the list instead of clearing it in one go.
    #
    #   -2  The rejection form narrowed the stamp to `.created_at`, while the
    #       guard it replaced used `(.updated_at // .created_at)`. A badge
    #       ADDED BY AN EDIT after the trigger then vanished. One stamp policy
    #       had been applied to three sites whose safety directions are
    #       opposite: the CLEAN path wants the conservative `created_at` (that
    #       is round 3's own `-4`), and this BLOCKING path wants the generous
    #       one. Generous here, conservative there — they are different
    #       questions, not one setting.
    #
    # Disposed ids are filtered inside the query so "is anything still
    # unanswered" is one decision rather than a check against a single id.
    # Challenge round 5, finding `challenge-r5-codex-adversarial-4` (confirmed
    # P1, and a reproduced FALSE CLEAN over a live P0): this bound was strict
    # while the clean-by-reaction path it races is inclusive
    # (`.created_at? >= $requested`, pinned by the suite case
    # `exact-trigger current-request +1 is clean`). So a badge stamped in the
    # TRIGGERS OWN SECOND was dropped while a reaction in that same second
    # certified the cycle clean — one second was the whole difference, and the
    # result carried no `unbound_badged` key at all, so the caller was never
    # told the finding existed.
    #
    # Conservative direction on a blocking scan: admitting one extra badge
    # costs a recorded disposition, dropping one costs the invariant this
    # whole form exists to hold.
    #
    # MAINTAINER RULING, review round 4 (findings `review-r4-codex-verification-1`
    # and `-2`, both confirmed P1): this scan has NO CLOCK. The invariant is
    #
    #   every undisposed badged comment from the pinned actor that names no
    #   reviewed commit and whose COMMENT ID exceeds the head FIRST TRIGGER
    #   ID blocks, and is answered by comment id.
    #
    # Comment ids are monotonic within one resource type, and the first
    # trigger id is written once per head at `attach` and never rebased, so
    # there is nothing left to get wrong about seconds, edits, windows,
    # reservations or reconstructions.
    #
    # MOOTED BY THIS RULING, and this is the point of it. Five consecutive
    # rounds across two stages each closed one leak in one timestamp seam and
    # each left another:
    #
    #   `challenge-r5-codex-adversarial-4`  strict bound dropped a badge in the
    #                                       trigger own second; made it
    #                                       inclusive, added an id tiebreak
    #   `review-r1-codex-verification-1`     the stamp and the tiebreak read
    #                                       different clocks; split the stamp
    #                                       by edit provenance
    #   `review-r2-codex-verification-2`     an edit inside the trigger second
    #                                       is indistinguishable from no edit;
    #                                       deleted the split, kept `>=`

    #                                       so a re-trigger hid a badge; moved
    #                                       the anchor to the reservation

    # this belong to" — ids can.
    #
    # DOCUMENTED BOUNDARY, accepted on the ruling rather than papered over: a
    # comment that PRE-EXISTS the first trigger and is later EDITED to add a
    # badge is NOT covered. Its id is below the boundary and no id ordering
    # can see the edit. That reverses `review-r1-codex-verification-1`, whose
    # suite case is retired with the tiebreak it pinned. The trade is
    # deliberate: that shape needs the reviewer to edit an older comment
    # instead of posting, while the clock-based alternatives demonstrably

    # Classifying a current-head result is three-way, not binary, because
    # "I cannot tell" is a real answer and reporting it as `findings` is a lie
    # that costs a clean PR its gate.
    #
    # The two Codex formats are structurally disjoint. A clean verdict is a
    # top-level comment whose first line is "Codex Review: Didn't find any
    # major issues." plus a praise clause. Findings are a review body opening
    # "### Codex Review", and the findings themselves are INLINE comments
    # carrying a severity badge — which are rejected before this point. So the
    # prefix is the real signal, and the trailing clause is decoration.
    #
    # Equality on the whole line was the original bug: Codex always appends
    # praise, so it never matched and no PR could satisfy the gate. Screening
    # the tail for "no colon, no digit" replaced it and was not a boundary
    # either — it admitted "… issues. However a race remains". Narrowing to a
    # short exclamation then rejected the real reply "… issues. Chef's kiss."
    # Each rule traded one failure direction for the other because it was
    # trying to read intent out of free text.
    #
    #   * does not open with the verdict sentence   -> findings
    #   * carries a severity marker anywhere        -> findings
    #   * a later line is not Codex's own metadata  -> INDETERMINATE
    #   * otherwise                                 -> clean
    #
    # The trailing clause is NOT one of those tests, and there is no list of
    # praise strings here to extend. Two families of rule were tried in that
    # position and both shipped broken. An allowlist of observed praise could
    # not converge — eight distinct clauses, three of them inside twenty-five
    # minutes — and it deadlocked the PR that was extending it, because that
    # PR's own clause was unlisted. The shape test that replaced it was
    # revised three times and was fail-OPEN each time within minutes of
    # review ("Tests fail on Windows.", "Nice work, tests crash on Windows.",
    # ":warning:", "Work on it."). Length separates nothing in either
    # direction: the longest observed praise, "already looking forward to the
    # next diff.", is 41 characters, and the caveat "But a race remains." is
    # 19.
    #
    # So the decision rests only on the parts of Codex's output that do not
    # vary. The full reasoning, and the residual this knowingly accepts, are
    # in the comment above `verdict_class`. Do not add a fourth attempt at
    # parsing the clause here — the residual is tracked as
    # evanharmon1/harmon-devkit#285.
    #
    # The verdict LINE is not the whole story either: a concern parked further
    # down the body carries no badge, so constraining only the first line let
    # "…issues. Keep it up!\n\nHowever a race remains." read as clean.
    # Everything after the verdict line must therefore be Codex's own metadata
    # — the "Reviewed commit" line and its collapsed About block — and any
    # other prose makes the result indeterminate.
    #
    # The About block is REMOVED rather than truncated at. Cutting the body at
    # the first "<details" validated only the text before it, so a concern
    # appended after the closing tag was invisible. An unterminated block does
    # not match the removal and its contents then fail the check, which is the
    # right direction.
    #
    # Removal is anchored on the block's SUMMARY, not on "<details" alone.
    # Discarding any collapsed block would let a concern hide inside one. The
    # summary is a stable identifier; the block's body is Codex's prose and is
    # deliberately not asserted on, because a reworded boilerplate would then
    # fail the gate on every PR. Residual, accepted knowingly: unbadged text
    # inside the genuine About block passes. A BADGED finding does not —
    # has_severity_marker scans the whole body, block included.
    #
    # And the metadata line is matched WHOLE. `startswith` on the label
    # accepted "**Reviewed commit:** `sha` However a race remains.", which is
    # the same trailing-text hole as the verdict line had, one line lower.
    # A Codex findings review is a body opening "### Codex Review" whose actual
    # findings ARE the inline comments partitioned above — `verdict_class` calls
    # that body `findings` because it does not open with the clean sentence. So
    # once a review's own findings are adjudicated, re-blocking on the review
    # that carried them would make the relaxation pointless: the same settled
    # findings, counted a second time from the other side.
    #
    # The correlation is PER REVIEW, via the `pull_request_review_id` each
    # inline comment carries. Same-head aggregation is not enough, and the
    # two-attempt contract makes the counterexample routine rather than exotic:
    # two findings reviews on one head, the first with adjudicated inline
    # comments and the second stating its finding in the review body alone. A
    # global "something was adjudicated" flag suppresses BOTH, and the check
    # reports adjudicated-clean over an unanswered finding.
    #
    # So a findings-classified current-head review is settled only when it has
    # at least one current-head bot inline comment attributed to it AND every
    # such comment is adjudicated. A findings review with nothing attributed to
    # it is never in the settled set, which subsumes the earlier rule about a
    # findings review with no inline comments at all. A settled review
    # contributes neither `findings` nor `clean` to the aggregate below — it is
    # answered, not a verdict — so an `unrecognized` sibling is still seen.
    #
    # One more condition, and it is not optional: a review whose BODY carries a
    # severity badge is never settled by its inline comments, however well
    # adjudicated those are. Codex states some findings in the review body
    # itself, and attribution cannot reach them — there is no inline comment to
    # reply to — so reclassifying the whole review on the strength of its
    # attributed comments would discard the badged one in silence.
    #
    # That test is `has_severity_marker`, the same whole-body scan
    # `verdict_class` uses, and it is deliberately content-NEGATIVE: it asks
    # whether a stable, machine-emitted badge is ABSENT, never what the prose
    # means. It therefore does not reopen the free-text failure family
    # documented above `verdict_class` — nothing here reads a clause, ranks a
    # phrasing, or maintains a corpus of observed wording.
    #
    # The badge test alone is not enough, for the reason the residual above
    # `verdict_class` records: an UNBADGED concern carries no marker. So a
    # settled review's body must additionally be CARRIER-ONLY — heading, the
    # pinned boilerplate sentence, whole-line Reviewed-commit metadata, the
    # About block, and nothing else non-blank (`is_carrier_only`). Between the
    # two tests the settled path has no free-text surface at all: a badge makes
    # it `findings`, and any other prose makes it not-settled, which is also
    # `findings`.
    #
    # Both failure directions therefore RE-BLOCK. If Codex rewords its
    # boilerplate or restyles its heading, settlement stops matching and the
    # check gates a PR it could have released; it never releases one it should
    # have gated. That is the opposite trade from the verdict line, where
    # pinning the tail deadlocked real PRs — there the strict reading was
    # fail-closed toward *blocking clean work*, here it is fail-closed toward
    # blocking work that still has an open finding.
    # `body_text != ""` drops EMPTY-BODY reviews from verdict classification,
    # and only from verdict classification. GitHub auto-creates a body-less
    # COMMENTED review
    # shell to carry inline comments (reply shells, and Codex's own shell
    # posted before its inline findings land), and an empty body is no
    # evidence in either direction: it has no verdict to be clean and no
    # free-text surface where an unanswered concern could hide — anything it
    # carries is inline comments, which the inline gate above already
    # classifies on their own. Once those comments attribute to its exact
    # review ID, the review timestamp orders their adjudicated result; an
    # unattributed shell remains no result at all. Classifying the shell itself
    # would read it as
    # `findings` (no clean opening sentence) and hard-block a cycle whose
    # real review has not arrived yet. `fetched_reviews` below deliberately
    # still includes shells: inline comments attribute to them by review ID,
    # and dropping the ID would make those comments read as naming a review
    # nobody fetched.
    # A DANGLING shell — an empty-body current-head review by the actor with
    # no inline comment attributed to it — is a review still in flight:
    # Codex posts the shell first and its verdict or findings only after, so
    # clean evidence OLDER than the newest dangling shell may be about to be
    # contradicted and is not accepted, while evidence NEWER than the shell
    # stands (that is the normal shell -> verdict order, so an abandoned
    # shell ages out instead of deadlocking the cycle). Every clean exit
    # below compares its own evidence timestamp against this barrier;

    # inline findings are fully adjudicated never appears in it at all, even
    # though `newest_result_record` above already orders such a review ahead
    # of an older non-empty one (see its own "ordering, not attempt
    # attribution" comment). When that happens, `review_result` can read
    # "clean" from the older review while `newest_result` correctly points at
    # the newer, adjudicated one; forcing the clean branch below to match
    # `newest_result` against the OLDER review's evidence then bounded-waits
    # forever, because the older review can never become the newest one it
    # already lost to. The same shape applies to a NON-empty review too: a
    # findings review whose inline findings are fully adjudicated is
    # reclassified to "settled" (not "clean") by `review_result_record`
    # above, so it likewise falls out of `review_result` while still being
    # able to win `newest_result` on the strength of its non-empty body.
    # Detect either case directly — `newest_result` names a review that is a
    # member of `$settled_reviews`, the inline-reply-adjudication set — and
    # skip the clean branch so control reaches the existing
    # `adjudicated_findings` branch below instead. This is a pure exclusion:
