# Mode: Audit

Audit an existing repo against the harmon-init conventions, report the drift, and
reconcile it. Use this mode when the goal is to **assess and remediate** a repo
(generated from the template or not) rather than scaffold a new one.

Source of truth: the harmon-init template at `~/git/harmon-init` (the `template/`
subdirectory is what gets generated; the repo root "dogfoods" the same conventions
for maintaining the template). The per-area checklist lives in
[`references/standards-catalog.md`](./standards-catalog.md) — that catalog is the
authoritative list of what "standardized" means; this file is the **procedure** for
walking it against a target and fixing gaps.

When audit remediation applies or updates the template, complete the shared
**Vendored skills** step in `SKILL.md`. Any vendored skills and agents it produces
ride in the standardize PR; they are part of the deliverable, not scratch output to
discard or split off.

---

## 1. Running the audit

Work the target repo area-by-area, in the same order the catalog
([`references/standards-catalog.md`](./standards-catalog.md)) presents them. For
each area: read the catalog entry, inspect the corresponding files in the target,
and compare against the template. Do not assert a gap from memory — verify it.

### Setup

```bash
TARGET=/abs/path/to/target-repo      # the repo being audited
TEMPLATE=~/git/harmon-init           # source of truth
```

Audit mode **does** require this local checkout. `$TEMPLATE` is read directly by
the catalog comparison below (step 2, and drift classes C and H in §3), and for a
never-templated repo it is the only source of truth available. The single
checkout-free step is the guarded drift helper in §3 drift class K
([`assets/diff-template.sh`](../assets/diff-template.sh)), which snapshots the
canonical remote itself — and it refuses to run at all on a repo with no
`.copier-answers.yml`.

1. **Establish provenance.** Check whether the repo was generated from the
   template: look for `.copier-answers.yml` at the target root.
   - Present → it can be reconciled with `copier update --trust` (it records
     `_commit` / `_src_path`). Note the recorded commit; drift is "template moved
     ahead since then." **Also check `_src_path` and `_commit` form a resolvable
     lineage tuple.** A relative/machine-local path can make `copier update` abort
     with `Updating is only supported in git-tracked templates`, but do not
     rewrite the path alone unless the recorded commit is reachable from the
     canonical remote (a real finding — see
     [copier-gotchas.md](./copier-gotchas.md) gotcha 8 / [mode-update.md](./mode-update.md) §2).
   - Absent → it was never templated (or was adopted by a raw `copier copy`).
     Reconciling the templated bits means a fresh adopt, but only from a released
     harmon-init tag whose `copier.yml` defines `use_coderabbit` and
     `use_codex_cloud_review`. Use the
     `HARMON_INIT_REF` guard and explicit answer in
     [mode-adopt-existing.md](./mode-adopt-existing.md), Path B; older releases
     render CodeRabbit unconditionally. Treat every catalog area as
     hand-verifiable rather than diff-against-answers.

2. **Walk each catalog area against the target.** For every area in
   `standards-catalog.md`, do the three-way check:
   - What the catalog requires.
   - What the template actually ships (read the real file under
     `$TEMPLATE/template/...`, or the dogfooded root copy — do not guess paths,
     task names, or tool versions).
   - What the target currently has.

   Useful evidence-gathering commands (read-only; never mutate the target during
   the audit phase):

   ```bash
   # AGENTS.md symlink direction (see drift class A)
   ls -la "$TARGET" | grep -iE 'AGENTS|CLAUDE|GEMINI'
   ls -la "$TARGET/.github/copilot-instructions.md" 2>/dev/null

   # Docs layout (drift class B)
   find "$TARGET/docs" -maxdepth 2 2>/dev/null | sort
   ls -d "$TARGET/specs" "$TARGET/tests" 2>/dev/null

   # Workflow inventory + extensions (drift classes E, F, G, H)
   ls -la "$TARGET/.github/workflows/"

   # Renovate/version-pin annotations (drift class C)
   grep -rnE 'GITLEAKS_VERSION|setup-task|# renovate:' "$TARGET/.github/workflows/" 2>/dev/null

   # Required checks and account-appropriate merge_queue policy (drift class D)
   find "$TARGET/.github" -iname '*ruleset*'

   # Triggers behind each required context (drift class D2): a path-filtered
   # pull_request/merge_group means the check never reports on an out-of-scope
   # change and wedges that merge
   grep -nE '^on:|^  (push|pull_request|merge_group):|^    paths(-ignore)?:' \
       "$TARGET/.github/workflows/"*.y*ml
   ```

3. **If `task` is available in the target**, run the standard gates as a live
   signal of conformance (they are themselves part of the standard):

   ```bash
   ( cd "$TARGET" && task verify )    # repo's fast check/build/validate/guard gate
   ( cd "$TARGET" && task security )  # secrets (gitleaks) + audit
   ```

   A repo missing `task verify` / `task security`, or whose tasks don't delegate
   lint to a Taskfile target, is itself a finding (the standard is "every hook /
   CI job delegates to a `task` target").

4. **Record each comparison as a gap-report line** (format in §2). Skip nothing:
   an area that fully matches is recorded as "OK" so the report is a complete
   ledger, not just a problem list.

---

## 2. Gap-report format

Produce one report, grouped by catalog area, in the catalog's order. Each finding
carries a **severity** and a **concrete fix** (the exact file/edit/command, not
"fix the workflow"). Severities:

- **blocker** — breaks a required CI gate, security control, or the branch
  ruleset; or makes `task verify` / `task security` fail. Must be fixed before the
  repo is "standardized."
- **should** — a real convention divergence with no immediate breakage (stale job
  names that still pass, missing docs scaffold, un-annotated version pins). Fix in
  the same pass unless explicitly deferred.
- **nice** — cosmetic / low-risk normalization (naming consistency, legacy
  graveyard cleanup).

### Template

```markdown
## <Area name, matching standards-catalog.md>

- [blocker] <one-line gap>
  - Evidence: <path:line or command output proving it>
  - Fix: <exact change — file to edit, command to run, or "re-template (§4)">
- [should] <one-line gap>
  - Evidence: ...
  - Fix: ...
- OK — <areas/items that already conform> (so the ledger is complete)
```

End the report with a short **Reconciliation plan**: the ordered list of fixes,
which ones a `copier` re-template will resolve automatically vs. which need a
hand-edit, and the verification command set from §4.

---

## 3. Common drift classes to check

These are the recurring divergences observed when porting real repos onto the
template. Treat the list as a checklist of likely findings — confirm each
against the target before reporting, and map each to its catalog area.

**A. AGENTS.md symlink direction.** Canonical layout: `AGENTS.md` is the real
file; `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, **and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** are
symlinks to it (copilot's default path is `.github/copilot-instructions.md` →
`../AGENTS.md`). Old repos invert this (`CLAUDE.md` real, the rest symlinked).
Fix: make `AGENTS.md` canonical, repoint the three symlinks, and flip the
prettier/lefthook symlink excludes (the template lefthook `pre-commit` prettier
step excludes `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` because
prettier errors when handed a symlink). Severity: **should** (blocker if a hook
fails on the symlink). `_preserve_symlinks: true` in `copier.yml` keeps these as
symlinks on re-template.

**B. Docs layout drift.** Standard docs tree (from `template/docs/`):
`docs/index.md`, `docs/architecture/{index,ci-cd,branch-protection,security,tests}.md`,
`docs/glossary.md`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/guides/{index,onboarding,deploying,troubleshooting}.md`,
`docs/product/{index,vision,domain,roadmap}.md`, `docs/decisions/` (ADRs, seeded
with `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` + `index.md`), and
`docs/runbooks/` — **plural `runbooks/`** (matches harmon-infra; old repos use
singular `runbook`). Also: `specs/` and `tests/` belong at **repo root**, not
under `docs/` (old repos nest `docs/specs/`). Common misses: no `guides/`, no
`product/`, no ADR dir, no `architecture/tests.md` or `glossary.md`. Fix: move
`docs/specs/` → `specs/`, rename `runbook/` → `runbooks/`, and add the missing
scaffold (a re-template fills these in; rename/move are hand-edits because copier
won't delete the old paths). Severity: **should**.

**C. Version pins lacking renovate annotations.** `gitleaks` and `arduino/setup-task`
must be pinned with a managed-version annotation so Renovate bumps them. Template
standard (verify against the real workflow — versions move):
- gitleaks via a `GITLEAKS_VERSION=...` env line preceded by
  `# renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=gitleaks/gitleaks extractVersion=^v?(?<version>.+)$`
- go-task via `arduino/setup-task@<sha> # v2.0.0` with `version:` preceded by
  `# renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=go-task/task extractVersion=^v(?<version>.+)$`

Old repos pin divergent, un-annotated versions (e.g. gitleaks 8.24.3 vs 8.21.2;
setup-task 3.51.1 vs 3.49.x). Fix: copy the annotated pin blocks from the current
template `build.yml`; do **not** hardcode a version from this doc — read the live
value from `$TEMPLATE/.github/workflows/build.yml`. Severity: **should** (blocker
if an unpinned/missing tool breaks the `security` job).

**D. Stale branch ruleset / old job names / wrong `merge_queue` policy.** Canonical
ruleset (`template/.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`) requires
the baseline contexts **`verify`** and **`security`**, plus
**`terraform-verify`** exactly when `include_terraform=true`, and
**`codeql-verify`** exactly when `use_codeql=true`. The
**`merge_queue`** rule is conditional: org repos
(`github_org != author_git_provider_username`) get it; personal-account repos do
not. Missing it is drift only for an org repo, while adding it to a personal repo
is itself drift. Old repos may reference retired job names (`secrets`, `validate`,
`build-homepage`) or carry the wrong account-type variant. Note this drift can
also live in *prose*: even the harmon-init root `docs/architecture/branch-protection.md`
still narrates the old `secrets`/`validate`/`build-homepage` contexts while the
shipped non-Terraform ruleset JSON is already `verify`+`security` — so check the
rendered JSON, not just the doc. Relatedly, ambiguous `verify` contexts: if both
`build.yml` and the
devcontainer workflow define a job literally named `verify`, either can satisfy
the required check — the template renames the devcontainer job to
**`devcontainer-verify`**. Fix: re-import the ruleset via the GitHub UI
(Settings → Rules → Rulesets → **Import a ruleset**) and choose the rendered
ruleset for the repo's account type. REST supports `merge_queue`, but a blind
`POST` is non-idempotent and can create duplicate rulesets; automation must
discover exactly one matching live ruleset and `PUT` that ruleset's id. Rename
the devcontainer job and align CI job names to the rendered required-check set.
Severity: **blocker** (wrong contexts mean the gate is unenforced or unsatisfiable).

**D2. A required context that cannot report.** Every context in the ruleset must
be reachable on every protected-event run, or that merge wedges forever waiting
on a status nobody posts. Three shapes, all blockers: (a) no workflow defines a
job with that key or `name:`; (b) the defining workflow lacks a `pull_request` /
`merge_group` trigger (dispatch- or schedule-only); (c) a trigger filter keeps
the workflow from starting on a protected ref. `verify-applied.sh` rejects all
three, taking the protected refs from the ruleset's own `ref_name.include`.
Filters are allowlisted, not blocklisted: under those events only `branches:`
(must cover the protected branch), `branches-ignore:` (must not name it), and
`types:` (must keep GitHub's full default set — `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened`
for `pull_request`, `checks_requested` for `merge_group`) are accepted, and any
other key — or a shape the auditor cannot read per key, such as an inline flow
mapping — is rejected on sight. Scope the *work*, not the
trigger: an internal change-detection job, never a workflow-level path filter.
`branches: [main]` is the standard's shape and fine, and path filters stay
correct on workflows that are not required checks. **Audit by hand:** wildcard
ruleset ref selectors (`refs/heads/releases/**`) select a branch set the verifier
warns about instead of deciding — a wildcard `include` gets no branch-coverage
check, and a wildcard `exclude` is left unapplied so the branches it might remove
stay audited. Do not confuse this class
with an event-dependent job-level `if:` on the reporting job: a skipped job still
posts a status and GitHub counts a skipped required check as *successful*, so
that one is fail-**open** (the gate is bypassed, not wedged) and belongs to the
`if: always()` + result-gating requirement in drift class D.
Severity: **blocker** (an unsatisfiable required check blocks every merge).

**E. YAML file extensions — NOT drift; do not flag.** `.yml` vs `.yaml` is left
to each tool's own convention (`Taskfile.yml`, `.yamllint.yml`; GitHub Actions
accepts either). Never rename a tool's file to homogenize extensions across the
repo. Severity: **none** (listed only so audits don't wrongly raise it).

**F. Duplicate / `-max` Claude workflows to consolidate.** Standard set is exactly
three: `claude-plan.yml`, `claude-implement.yml`, `claude-review.yml`. Old repos
carry duplicates like `claude-review-max.yml` / `claude-implement-max.yml`. Fix:
delete the `-max` duplicates, keep the three canonical workflows. Severity:
**should** (blocker if a duplicate fires redundant/conflicting automation).

**G. CodeQL selection drift.** The template ships a CodeQL workflow only when
`use_codeql=true`, using exactly the persisted `codeql_languages` matrix.
Repositories with supported first-party source and live Code Security capability
should make that intent explicit; tooling flags alone are not evidence. Public
repositories run it automatically and for free; private/internal repositories
require GitHub Code Security plus the explicit `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN=true` opt-in.
When `use_codeql=false`, CodeQL artifacts and claims must be absent and Semgrep CE
provides the baseline SAST route. Fix by re-templating with reviewed answers.
Severity: **should**.

Presence of the workflow alone is not coverage. The analyze job/action must not use
`continue-on-error`; public and paid-private analyses must succeed, while the
stable `codeql-verify` aggregate may accept `skipped` only for a free-private
route or an untrusted fork. That fork aggregate must not check out or execute
fork-controlled repository code on the aggregate runner. Treat unset/empty
`FULL_SECURITY_SCAN` as the free-private opt-out, and verify the language matrix
against real first-party source rather than tooling flags. When a legacy
`.copier-answers.yml` has no `use_codeql` field, infer the intended route from
the workflow, repository visibility, live Code Security capability, and actual
source before changing it.

**G2. Snyk policy drift.** Snyk is not required PR CI. The default Copier answer
is `snyk_scan_schedule=off`, with manual/local second-opinion targets named
`security:sast:snyk` and `security:sca:snyk`. A generated
`snyk-scheduled.yml` is valid only when the recorded answer is `weekly` or
`daily`; it must have schedule/manual triggers only and remain outside branch
protection. Flag an Actions `SNYK_TOKEN` when no scheduled or deliberately paid
Snyk workflow consumes it, and flag legacy Snyk PR/push jobs as policy drift.
Severity: **should** (blocker if an unintended required check makes PRs
unsatisfiable).

**G3. CodeRabbit selection drift.** Read `use_coderabbit` from
`.copier-answers.yml`; for legacy answers that omit it, apply the current
fleet default of `false` unless the maintainer explicitly reviews and retains
the integration. When true, `.coderabbit.yaml`, the conditional setup
instructions, and `coderabbitai[bot]` trust must all be present. When false,
all three must be absent. Also require a human-verifiable checklist item to
remove the repository from the CodeRabbit GitHub App installation: repository
files cannot prove or revoke external App access, so record that live access
check as `?` until a human confirms it. Stale local config/trust is a
**should** finding; an omitted App-access confirmation is a **should** manual
finding.

**G4. Codex cloud review selection drift.** Read
`use_codex_cloud_review` from `.copier-answers.yml`; for legacy answers that
omit it, use `false`. When true, `use_codex_review` must also be true and the
repository must set `use_skills_sync=true` with `universal` in
`skill_categories` — **unless the repo is the skills source itself**, i.e. it
ships the classifier natively as a git-tracked, non-symlink executable regular
file at `ai/skills/universal/integrate/assets/check-codex-cloud-review.sh`,
*and* tracks the `integrate` skill's entry point
`ai/skills/universal/integrate/SKILL.md` as a regular file — index mode `100644`
or `100755`, so a `120000` symlink does not qualify however valid its target,
the same `-type f` stance `verify-skills.sh` takes — with valid frontmatter: the
opening `---` block must **close** (checked statically, since a parser given an
unclosed block whose body is valid YAML reads it happily), and its values are
then resolved by **yq**, the same hard prerequisite the rest of the guarded
update already carries. `name` must resolve to the string `integrate` and
`description` to a non-empty string, so quoting, block scalars, comments, and
the null spellings are the parser's problem rather than a pattern's. A
`description` that resolves to null, a collection, a number, or a boolean is
not a description. Unparseable YAML answers "not a valid skills source" rather
than "cannot tell". `scripts/verify-skills.sh` remains canonical for layout —
*and* that helper's
**executable body** carries the dispatch `case` arms for all five verbs
(`reserve)`, `attach)`, `check)`, `show)`, `reap)`) together with the exit-code
contract the integrate stage reads — `emit pending` with `exit 11` and
`emit escalate` with `exit 13` (harmon-devkit, which may keep
`use_skills_sync=false`). For such a repo the sync/`universal` requirement is
waived, matching the update-mode guard in `mode-update.md` — which applies
exactly that tracked/non-symlink/executable test plus those two, so an ignored,
untracked, or symlinked helper does **not** qualify here, and neither does a
`100755` stub, a tree whose `SKILL.md` is missing, untracked, or frontmatter-less,
or a no-op helper whose **comments merely print** the usage forms. That last case
is why the anchors are structural: the guard strips comment lines before matching,
so a printed banner cannot stand in for a dispatch table. All of these probes are
**static**: they establish that the interface is shipped, never that it runs
correctly — audit is a read-only stage and must not execute the repo to find out,
and a helper deliberately shaped to match the anchors would still pass. Do not report its `use_skills_sync=false` as G4 drift when that native
classifier is present. The rendered `AGENTS.md` plus `integrate` skill must require a terminal result
attributable to every current PR head, preserve exact trigger-attempt state,
and escalate after two unavailable attempts without a CI-only fallback. The
repository cannot prove external connector access or plan/quota availability,
so record those as human-verifiable `?` items (including explicit connector
permission for private repositories). Also require a human-confirmed disabled
state for Codex Automatic reviews — review **Trigger** knob included; the
post-generation checklist states the full knob list: explicit draft-time
requests are the authoritative cycles, and ready-for-review promotion must not
trigger another untracked review. When false, the required Codex cloud
signal and its setup instructions must be absent. Stale policy or an
unreviewed legacy opt-in is a **should** finding; an unsatisfiable required
signal is a blocker.

**H. lint-hygiene script portability to macOS bash 3.2.** `scripts/lint-hygiene.sh`
must be portable: **no `mapfile`, no `grep -P`** (both Linux/bash-4-only), and it
must self-skip in a path-independent way (skip any copy of the script so its own
pattern strings don't match) and skip symlinks (the AGENTS.md aliases). Old infra
copies use `mapfile` + `grep -P` and a brittle self-skip. Fix: replace with the
template version (`$TEMPLATE/scripts/lint-hygiene.sh`). Severity: **blocker** if
`task lint:hygiene` errors on macOS; otherwise **should**.

**I. Brewfile ↔ local-tooling parity (run-locally goal).** The repo must be able
to run its baseline tooling on a **bare host**, not only in the devcontainer
(catalog 1.11 "Local ↔ devcontainer parity"). Every binary the routine gates,
lefthook hooks, and `scripts/` invoke must be installable via the `Brewfile`;
when a devcontainer exists, the same toolset must also be in the devcontainer
`Dockerfile`. Explicit optional integration targets are the exception: the
`*:snyk` targets require a separately installed CLI locally, while the generated
scheduled workflow installs its own pinned CLI. The
recurring miss: a binary added to the `Dockerfile` (so it works in-container) but
never added to the `Brewfile`, so the matching `task` fails on a fresh host
(observed with `gum` — the `status` dashboard renderer — and `television`/`tv` —
the interactive `task` menu; also `tokei`). Build the invoked-tool set and diff it
against the `Brewfile`:

```bash
# Tools the repo invokes (tasks + hooks + scripts), then what Brewfile installs
grep -rhoE '\b(gum|tv|television|tokei|jq|yq|fzf|fd|ripgrep|bat|shfmt|shellcheck|actionlint|yamllint|gitleaks|hadolint|lychee|direnv|terraform|terraform-docs|tflint|black|ansible-lint|pip-audit|uv|uvx|pnpm|node|npx|gh|lefthook|delta)\b' \
  "$TARGET/Taskfile.yml" "$TARGET/lefthook.yml" "$TARGET"/scripts/*.sh 2>/dev/null | sort -u
grep -oE 'brew "[^"]+"' "$TARGET/Brewfile" | sort -u
# If a devcontainer exists, the Dockerfile should cover the same set:
grep -rnE 'ARG .*_VERSION|apt-get install' "$TARGET"/.devcontainer/*ockerfile* 2>/dev/null
```

Map invoked binaries to their brew formula (note the names differ: `tv` →
`television`, `rg` → `ripgrep`, npx/pnpm-run tools resolve through `node`/`pnpm`,
Semgrep/`black`/`ansible-lint`/`pip-audit` through `uv`/`uvx`). Anything invoked
by a routine gate but not installable is a gap. Fix: add the missing
`brew "<formula>"` to the `Brewfile`
(template owns it — prefer `copier update`, else hand-add), and to the
devcontainer `Dockerfile` if one exists. Severity: **blocker** if the missing
tool makes a routine `task` target fail on a host (e.g. bare `task` → `tv`);
**should** if the task degrades gracefully (e.g. `status` without `gum`).

**Additional recurring findings (verify per repo):** legacy-bloated
`Brewfile` (deprecated formulae, missing gitleaks/yamllint/actionlint); CI that
reinstalls lint tools inline every run instead of using the prebuilt devcontainer
image / a composite action; auto-release-on-merge `release.yml` (standard is
release-please — an intentional rolling release PR, `use_release_please: yes` by
default; `task release:*` stays a manual override); stale `CHECKLIST.md`
(mentions pre-commit/cookiecutter); naming inconsistency between
workspace/bunch/slug files and the repo slug. Map each to its catalog area and
assign severity by the §2 rubric.

**J. Missing universal Taskfile targets (e.g. `status:setup`).** Every
standardized repo defines the universal targets from
[`standards-catalog.md`](./standards-catalog.md) §1.2 regardless of
`project_type` — notably `verify`, `check`, `security`, `install:hooks`, and
**`status:setup`** (the setup-completeness audit, `./scripts/status.sh setup`).
Repos whose `Taskfile` / `scripts/status.sh` predate or forked away from the
template often lack `status:setup` (the older `status.sh` had no `setup`
section). Detect by listing targets (`task --list-all`) and checking the
universal set; `assets/verify-applied.sh` enforces this. Fix: port the
setup-check helpers + the "Setup Completeness" section from the template's
`scripts/status.sh` (preserving any repo-specific sections) and add the
`status:setup` task. Severity: **should**.

**K. Template-owned file content drift (the general check).** The generalization of
H/J and the bootstrap/idempotency class: any **template-owned** file (the set in
[`assets/template-owned-files.txt`](../assets/template-owned-files.txt) —
`Taskfile.yml`, `scripts/*.sh`, lint configs, the standard `.github/workflows/*`,
devcontainer files) that no longer matches a fresh render is potentially missing
template improvements. Singleton config the manifest deliberately omits —
`.devflow.toml` (catalog §1.13; the `rigor`/`strategy`/`tier` round-cap and
model-routing config), `label-registry.json`, `agent-registry.json` — is still
caught: it is just a rendered path the repo also has, so the uncurated sweep
below reports its drift too, tagged `(uncurated)` rather than plain `DRIFT`.
Read an uncurated `.devflow.toml` diff with the manifest's own caveat in mind —
a repo retuning its round caps ("Retuning these is expected", per the file's
own header) is customization, not a regression to restore; a `[rigor.*]`/
`[strategy.*]` table dropped entirely, or the `[tier.*]` ladder itself edited,
is worth a closer look. Detect it mechanically — this is how the audit "checks
everything" instead of eyeballing each file:

```bash
assets/diff-template.sh "$TARGET"
# --show to see the per-file diff
```

Do not set `HARMON_INIT` for a normal audit. The helper verifies the recorded
source is canonical, snapshots that remote, removes its remote, rejects
submodules, and renders the full recorded commit from the read-only clone. A
legacy tag-valued `_commit` has no immutable historical proof, so show the
maintainer the current canonical tag mapping and obtain approval before running
with `ACCEPT_LEGACY_BASELINE=true`; a full commit needs no recovery approval.
An explicit `HARMON_INIT` is only for a caller that already built an equivalent
guarded clone (update mode passes `HARMON_INIT_RECORDED_COMMIT`) or for a
disposable hermetic test.

The helper renders harmon-init **at the repo's own frozen `_commit`** (from its
`.copier-answers.yml`) and content-compares the **entire render** against the repo
(mapping `.yml`↔`.yaml`), not just the curated set. Curated entries report plain
**`DRIFT`**; every other rendered path the repo also has reports the same
**`DRIFT`** tagged `(uncurated — not in template-owned-files.txt)`, with identical
review-aid semantics — the tag records that the hand-maintained manifest has not
adopted the file, not a lower severity. **`MODE`** (executable-bit) differences are
reported independently of content on both sides of that line. The **`MISSING`**
scan is likewise **manifest-independent**, so a file the template added after the
curated list was last edited — or one a hand-reconciled update dropped — is still
caught (`.gitkeep` dir-stubs show as benign `ABSENT`).
An absent tracked path that still exists in the index is compared from an index
snapshot, so a transient, unstaged working-tree deletion does not create false
drift; once the deletion is staged it is real `MISSING`. Mature nested Terraform
roots and an established or renumbered ADR log are reported as benign `EQUIV`
instead of false `MISSING` and do not affect the exit status.

Three further classes are informational — **their content never affects the exit
status** (a `MODE` finding on the same file still gates) — and their diffs are
withheld even under `--show`:

- **`OWNED`** — the **template itself** declares the path repo-owned, by listing
  it in `copier.yml`'s `_skip_if_exists` (`CHANGELOG.md`, `*.code-workspace`,
  `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.devcontainer/related-repos.txt`,
  `.release-please-manifest.json`). Once such a file exists copier never writes
  it again — not on adopt, not on update — so its divergence is not drift in any
  sense the template can act on, and it used to report as gating uncurated
  `DRIFT` in every mature repo. The list is **derived at run time** from the very
  commit that was rendered, matched with git's own gitignore dialect (the same
  one copier uses), so it cannot go stale; a declaration that cannot be read, is
  malformed, negated, or templated exits `2` rather than quietly returning every
  declared path to `DRIFT`. A baseline that simply **predates** the declaration
  is a different fact — harmon-init added `_skip_if_exists` in v3.4.0 while a
  guarded audit accepts any v3.0.0 descendant — so those runs continue without
  the class and **say so**, on stderr and again in the summary, rather than
  being refused or quietly degraded. Distinct from `CO-OWNED` on purpose: that one
  is a hand-maintained judgement about *prose the repo rewrote*, this one is the
  template's machine-readable statement about *who owns the file*, and it covers
  paths nobody would call prose. Where the two overlap, `OWNED` wins. It says
  nothing about **absence** — copier freezes a declared path only when it
  exists — so a declared path the repo lacks is still `MISSING`.
- **`CO-OWNED`** — the template seeds the file but the repo owns its **prose**
  (`AGENTS.md` and its symlink aliases, `README.md`, the **`*.md` under**
  `docs/` and `specs/`, the devcontainer `config/zshrc`, …). Those two tree
  globs are filtered to Markdown on purpose: a build script or generated config
  under a docs tree is not prose anybody rewrote, and it gates as ordinary
  uncurated `DRIFT`. Divergence in the prose is the expected steady state, so
  the line is presence-only; withholding the diff is what keeps it from drowning
  the report. Its value is the inverse signal — a `CO-OWNED` path that stops
  being listed after an update was clobbered back to the template's copy.
- **`IGNORED`** — the copy is **untracked, and both the repo *and the template*
  ignore the path** (a resolved `.envrc`, local editor settings). Presence-only
  for the same reason plus a harder one: a resolved local config can hold real
  secrets, so its diff is never printed. It is also a **sweep-only** class: a
  path on
  [`template-owned-files.txt`](../assets/template-owned-files.txt) always gates,
  ignore rules or not, because the manifest is itself an assertion of template
  ownership and ignore-based leniency cannot override it — `.claude/settings.json`
  is on that list and reports `DRIFT` however thoroughly a repo ignores it.
  Withholding still applies to those paths. **The template's declaration is what
  grants this exemption, never the repo's habits**: the check is the render's
  own `.gitignore`, so a path the repo ignores while the template *tracks* it
  gates instead, tagged `(repo-ignored, but the template tracks this file —
  other clones will not have it)` — adding `.vscode/` to your own `.gitignore`
  says nothing about the artifact, and every other clone still renders it. Its
  body stays withheld all the same: withholding follows the path under the
  union of both rule sets, so being wrong about whether something is drift never
  makes its contents safe to print.

Symlinks are compared by **link target**, so the `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md` /
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` aliases stay silent instead of restating one
`AGENTS.md` divergence four times. A symlink-versus-regular-file mismatch is
structural and **does** gate, `OWNED` or `CO-OWNED` or not.
Because the render is at `_commit`, each **`DRIFT`** is the repo's **local
customization** relative to its own baseline — or a **regression** where a past
hand-reconcile dropped a same-baseline improvement (the status.sh / lint-hygiene /
bootstrap class). It is **not** a newer-version improvement — those arrive via the
`copier update` merge, not diff-template. Read the diff to tell them apart: restore
a regression (copy the template's version), and leave a deliberate customization,
reconciling **in place** (keep it in its normal file — do not extract it elsewhere). Severity: **should** (blocker if the drift breaks a
required gate, e.g. a non-portable `lint-hygiene.sh`). Run this as a standard step of
every audit.

**Recognized equivalents and remaining false-`MISSING` categories — verify
before "fixing".** Some apparent gaps are legitimate divergences, not missing
standards; re-adding the template's seed is wrong. The recurring ones:

- **chezmoi `private_`/`dot_` prefix** — a dotfiles repo names the template's root
  `Brewfile` `private_Brewfile` (→ `~/Brewfile`), so `Brewfile` reads `MISSING`. Add
  a root `Brewfile` per [mode-adopt-existing.md](./mode-adopt-existing.md) §4.7, not
  a "restored" copy.
- **ADR renumbering** — the seed `docs/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`
  is `EQUIV` when the repo carries a renumbered record-decisions ADR or already
  has a README-backed numbered ADR log. Don't re-add — it would duplicate.
- **Replaced terraform skeleton** — an iac repo with real infra (e.g.
  `terraform/environments/…`) deleted the template's flat
  `terraform/{main,variables,outputs}.tf` skeleton. Nested `*.tf` roots make
  these seed paths `EQUIV`; leave the real layout in place.
- **Gitignored `.envrc`** — a repo that resolves `.envrc`/`.envrc.local` from an
  `.envrc.tpl` via `op inject` gitignores the resolved file, so it reads `MISSING`.
  Leave it (it's the secure pattern the template now ships).
- **`.prettierrc.cjs` vs `prettier.config.cjs`** — a web/node repo that uses the
  `.prettierrc.cjs` filename (higher precedence in Prettier's config search) instead
  of the template's `prettier.config.cjs` reads as `MISSING prettier.config.cjs`. An
  intentional filename divergence (like `.yml`/`.yaml`, drift class E), **not** a gap.
  `copier update` correctly leaves it alone — the file is unchanged between template
  versions, so nothing is added and no dead second config results. Confirm the repo
  actually has a `.prettierrc*`/`prettier` package.json key, then leave it.

**Everything that survives that list is a PERMANENT non-adoption candidate.**
Audit mode has a single render, at the repo's own `_commit`, so it cannot split
`MISSING` into "the template just added this" and "the template has shipped this
all along" — that baseline-versus-target classification exists only in update
mode ([`mode-update.md`](./mode-update.md) §1). What audit mode *can* say is the
part that matters, and it can say it precisely: this render **is** the repo's
baseline, so every path it reports `MISSING` is by definition one the template
already shipped at that baseline — which is exactly the condition under which
`copier update` will never restore a file. The three-way merge reads the absence
as the repo's own deletion and preserves it, and each update resets the baseline
so the file is never offered again
([`copier-gotchas.md`](./copier-gotchas.md) §9). The absence **is** the opt-out,
whether or not anyone chose it. That is why a `MISSING` finding must be
dispositioned — restored, or declined with a reason on the record — and not
shrugged at as something the next update will pick up. There is no next update
that will.

**Check BOTH re-creation carve-outs before dispositioning any of them**
([`copier-gotchas.md`](./copier-gotchas.md) §9): a path listed under
`_skip_if_exists`, and any path the template's own `.gitignore` covers — copier
builds its comparison tree with `git add -A`, so a render-ignored path is
invisible to the deleted-path scan and is re-rendered every update however
deliberately it was removed. A path in either group is not preserved-absent: `copier update` renders it fresh
whenever the repo lacks it, so its `MISSING` is temporary and resolves itself on
the next update. harmon-init lists `CHANGELOG.md`, `*.code-workspace`,
`.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.release-please-manifest.json`, and
`.devcontainer/related-repos.txt`. Reading that list is a **fallback**, and an
imperfect one — the pattern semantics are copier's, not git's, and matching them
by hand is exactly the guesswork that
[`mode-update.md`](./mode-update.md) §1 stopped doing when it started rehearsing
the apply against a scratch copy and simply watching which files came back.
Audit mode has one render and no update to rehearse, so it has no such
observation available; read the list, set those paths aside, and keep the
warning attached, because `.github/CODEOWNERS` returning means access-control
rules returning. Where it matters, run the guarded update and read its report
instead of deciding from the pattern list.

**One `MISSING` line is outside that population**, and it says so in its own
note: `tracked in HEAD but staged for removal`. That path is still in `HEAD` and
its worktree copy is still on disk, so nothing is absent for an update to
restore and there is no non-adoption to disposition — the finding is a pending
index state, and the answer is to reconcile the staged deletion. Commit it and
the path becomes genuinely absent, at which point the paragraph above applies
to it like any other.

**L. Workflow ↔ Taskfile/runtime contract.** Every `task <target>` referenced in
`.github/workflows/*.yml` must exist in `Taskfile.yml`. CI's `lint`/`build` jobs
call targets `task verify` never runs (e.g. `test:tasks`, `test:hooks`,
`test:devcontainer:permissions`), so a Taskfile that drifted from the template —
or was restored wholesale from a pre-template `main` during a Path-B adopt while
the template's workflows were taken as-is — can omit them. The result is the worst
kind of green: `task verify` (and `verify-applied.sh`'s §1 gate) passes locally
while CI goes **red**, because the gate doesn't exercise what CI does. Detect the
contract directly:

```bash
grep -rhoE '(run:[[:space:]]*|^[[:space:]]*|&&[[:space:]]*)task +[a-z][a-z0-9:_-]*' \
  .github/workflows/ | sed -E 's/.*task +//' | sort -u
# then assert each is in `task --list-all`
```

`assets/verify-applied.sh` (§3c) enforces this. Fix: port the missing targets and
their `scripts/*.sh` helpers from the template (or reconcile the preserved Taskfile
against the adopted workflows). Severity: **blocker** (the gate is unenforced and CI
is unsatisfiable until the targets exist).

A repo-specific test is a gate only when all three links exist: the root
`Brewfile`/`task install` provides its runtime locally, the workflow provisions
that runtime in CI, and the workflow invokes `task test` (or the specific target)
rather than a narrower `test:tasks`. Check this manually for every added test;
this audit found both Copier-backed skill tests and a chezmoi render test that
passed locally but were initially unreachable or unprovisioned in CI. Read the
middle link per **job**, not per workflow: a runtime is provisioned for a gate
only by that job's own steps or by a composite action that job uses. Setup steps
in a sibling job, an unused `./.github/actions/*`, or a dead workflow put nothing
on the gate job's runner.

Target names are also insufficient to prove workflow semantics. Compare the
`on` events/inputs and each job's `if`, `needs`, permissions, and side effects
against the pre-update workflow. In particular, preserve intentional
`workflow_dispatch` deploy/apply paths and their guards; YAML/actionlint can be
green while a Terraform apply path has silently disappeared.

For every aggregate job under `if: always()`, inspect its result reduction.
Generic `success || skipped` acceptance is fail-open. A fork PR must require every
fork-suppressed leaf to be exactly `skipped` in a workflow-inline diagnostic that
does not check out or execute repository-controlled code. Same-repository and
non-PR events must require every required leaf to be exactly `success`.
Conditionally disabled leaves may skip only when the aggregate derives that exact
expectation from the same explicit change/enabled predicates. Apply this contract
to both build `verify` and `devcontainer-verify`; reject cancellation, timeout,
unexpected skip/success, and unknown states.

For Python CI that consumes an existing `uv.lock`, distinguish validation from
mutation. Exports must use `uv export --locked`; syncs must use
`uv sync --locked` (or first run `uv lock --check`). `--frozen` skips the
freshness check. Treat a stale lock or a tracked lock rewrite as a blocker; keep
lock creation and updates in explicit local/update workflows.

When `runs-on` is variable-controlled (for example, `CI_RUNS_ON`), audit both
repository visibility and event trust. Every public `pull_request` job must
resolve to a GitHub-hosted runner. A same-repository job guard is defense in
depth, not a complete trust boundary. Self-hosted use in private/trusted repos or
on trusted push/dispatch events also needs server-side repository-scoped runner
groups and clean ephemeral/JIT isolation; otherwise treat it as a blocker. This
is currently a manual residual: do not assume the template's configurable
`runs-on` expression mechanically enforces the hosted-only public-PR policy.

For a Terraform-capable repo (`include_terraform=true` or real first-party `.tf`
files), prove the local/CI lint chain before reviewing mutation. Both
`task --dry check` and `task --dry lint:terraform` must reach format check,
TFLint, Renovate-pinned Checkov through `uvx --from`, and the provider-lock check. The
root `Brewfile` must provision Terraform/TFLint/uv locally, and the build workflow
must provision the same capabilities before the shared task runs. Task names or
documentation without command/tool reachability are not coverage.

Then trace the Terraform workflow chain: change detection → validation → saved
plan → exact-plan apply → aggregate. A tracked `.terraform.lock.hcl` makes CI init
use `-lockfile=readonly`, but file presence alone says nothing about platform
checksums. Require `scripts/terraform-provider-locks.sh`: lint calls `check`, the
explicit `terraform:providers:lock` mutation task calls `update`, and the helper
targets exactly `darwin_arm64` + `linux_amd64` in a scratch copy. Run its hermetic
regression and prove update initialization receives `-upgrade` while check
initialization does not; otherwise a constraint bump beyond the committed lock
fails before `providers lock`, or check mode compares against upgraded selections
instead of the committed-lock semantics. A fresh no-provider scaffold may skip
cleanly. Only explicit fresh scaffolding may create the first lock, while an
intentional local provider update may refresh it.
Plan/apply must be downstream of validation, guarded/namespaced to the trusted
run, and apply must refuse to re-plan if the private run-scoped saved plan is
absent. Confirm the summary displays that same plan, state-lock waits are bounded
(never `-lock=false`), and cleanup runs under `if: always()`.

A required `terraform-verify` must always emit on `push`, `pull_request`,
`merge_group`, and `workflow_dispatch`, including unrelated-path no-ops; use an
internal change detector, not workflow-level path filters (drift class **D2**
generalizes this to every required context). Derive every accepted
`skipped` result from explicit fork/change/enabled predicates and reject all
other states. Agents must also retain the exact-operation approval rule for
Terraform mutation; only the reviewed trusted-main exact-plan CI path is exempt.

On workflows that may use self-hosted runners, reject shared fixed `/tmp`
filenames for sensitive or cross-step artifacts (especially saved Terraform
plans). Use a private per-repo/run directory beneath `${{ runner.temp }}`,
propagate the exact path, and clean it up so concurrent or later jobs cannot
read, replace, or collide with it.

## 4. Fix flow

Apply fixes on a branch, prefer re-templating for files copier owns, then verify.

1. **Branch.** Never commit to `main` (the template enforces a
   `guard:no-commit-to-main` lefthook hook + a branch ruleset; respect it in the
   target too). Create a feature branch, e.g.:

   ```bash
   ( cd "$TARGET" && git switch -c chore/standardize-with-harmon-init )
   ```

2. **Apply fixes.** Two tracks — do the re-template first so hand-edits layer on
   top of refreshed templated files:

   - **Templated bits — re-run copier.** For files the template owns, reconcile
     rather than hand-porting:
     - Generated from the template (has `.copier-answers.yml`):

       Follow [`mode-update.md`](./mode-update.md) end to end so the release and
       explicit Codex cloud review and CodeRabbit choices are identical in
       preview and apply.

     - Never templated / adopting fresh:

       Follow Path B in
       [`mode-adopt-existing.md`](./mode-adopt-existing.md), including its
       remote-tag validation and explicit `use_codex_cloud_review` and
       `use_coderabbit` answers.

     A local `--vcs-ref=HEAD` render is appropriate for a disposable pre-release
     preview, not the production adoption, because dirty work can record an
     unreachable throwaway commit. Answer the questions to match the repo, and
     keep all side-effectful answers
     (`github_remote_create`, `github_release_init`, `bunch_add`,
     `obsidian_project_add`, `run_task_install`) at their **no** defaults so the
     adopt has no side effects. Review the resulting diff carefully and discard
     overwrites of intentional local divergences.

   - **Non-templated bits — hand-edit.** Copier won't *delete* or *move* files,
     so renames and relocations are manual: `git mv docs/specs specs`,
     `git mv docs/runbook docs/runbooks`, delete `-max`
     duplicate workflows, re-import the branch ruleset JSON (via the GitHub UI),
     repoint the AGENTS.md symlinks. Use the gap report's Reconciliation plan as the work
     list.

3. **Verify locally.** Run the same gates the standard requires, from the target:

   ```bash
   ( cd "$TARGET" && task verify )    # repo's fast check/build/validate/guard gate
   ( cd "$TARGET" && task security )  # gitleaks + dependency audit
   ```

   Fix anything red and re-run until clean. The exact fast targets are
   profile/repo-specific; `task ci` additionally chains the heavier `test` and
   `security` aggregates.

4. **Run the applied-state verifier.** Confirm the audited drift classes are
   actually resolved by running the skill's checker:

   ```bash
   assets/verify-applied.sh "$TARGET"
   ```

   (See [`../assets/verify-applied.sh`](../assets/verify-applied.sh) — it should
   re-check the §3 drift classes against the target and exit non-zero on any
   remaining **blocker**. If the script isn't present yet in this skill, fall back
   to manually re-walking the gap report's Reconciliation plan.)

5. **Hand back.** Leave the changes committed on the feature branch with a
   Conventional-Commits message (e.g. `chore: standardize against harmon-init`).
   Read the rendered target `AGENTS.md`: open a draft PR and use the
   draft-workbench lifecycle only when that authoritative policy defines
   ready-for-review as the human handoff. If it still defines an ordinary PR or
   stop-at-green handoff, select a compatible harmon-init release or follow the
   target policy and report the lifecycle upgrade as blocked. On a compatible
   target, shepherd the unchanged head through every required check and review,
   promote it to ready for human + code-owner review only after the complete
   readiness gate passes, and then stop — releases and merges stay intentional;
   do not merge or tag.
