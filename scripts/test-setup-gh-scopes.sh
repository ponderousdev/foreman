#
# Its refusals are the safety story (an env token it cannot fix, a shell that
# cannot complete a browser flow) and its post-refresh verification is the

# than was asked for. None of that is exercised by test-status.sh, which only
# covers the status consumer.
#
# Hermetic in two directions, as test-status.sh is:
#
#   * every `gh` call is answered by a stub on PATH, so this never reaches
#     GitHub and never touches the developer's own credential — which is the
#     whole point: the bug it guards (reporting a refresh that did not land)
#     is INVISIBLE when tested against a token that already has the scopes.
#   * the script runs from a fixture root this test builds, never the repo it
#     lives in, so the required-scope list under test is the fixture's.
