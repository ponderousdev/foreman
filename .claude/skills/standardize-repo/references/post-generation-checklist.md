# Post-Generation Checklist

Steps to run **after** `copier copy` finishes and the generated files are
committed to the repo. Generalized from harmon-init's own
`template/docs/CHECKLIST.md.jinja`; see also `docs/architecture/security.md` for
the GitHub App rationale.

Every step is tagged **[scriptable via gh]** (an agent can run it
non-interactively) or **[human-only]** (requires a browser/UI, a one-time secret
the agent must not fabricate, or a deliberate manual action per the security
model). For scriptable steps the exact `gh` command is given.

Throughout, substitute the copier answers:

- `<org>` — the `github_org` answer (defaults to the author's username; an
  **org** repo is one where `github_org != author_git_provider_username`).
- `<repo>` — the `project_slug` answer.
- `<project_type>` — one of `general`, `web-astro`, `web-app`, `iac`, `docs`.
- `<snyk_scan_schedule>` — one of `off` (default), `weekly`, or `daily`.

Run from the generated repo's root, on the default branch, after the first
push so the remote exists.

---

## 1. Local setup

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Install deps + git hooks. Installs Brewfile deps
      and, depending on copier answers, `uv sync` (Python) / `pnpm install`
      (Node) plus lefthook hooks.

  ```bash
  task install
  ```

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Confirm the full local gate passes before relying
      on CI.

  ```bash
  task verify
  ```

---

## 2. GitHub repo settings

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Import the branch ruleset that protects `main`
      (required reviews + the `verify`/`security` status checks, plus
      `codeql-verify` when `use_codeql=true`). The JSON is generated into the
      repo's `.github/`. Import it via the UI:
      **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New ruleset ▸ Import a ruleset** → select
      `.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`. To change an
      existing ruleset, edit it in the UI — don't re-import.

  > REST supports `merge_queue`, but a blind `POST` is **not idempotent**
  > (re-running can create a duplicate ruleset). Safe automation must first
  > discover exactly one matching live ruleset and then `PUT` that ruleset's id.
  > Keep the initial import explicit in the UI.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Enable **Dependabot alerts**. Do NOT add a
      `dependabot.yml` — Renovate owns version updates; Dependabot is alerts-only.

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/vulnerability-alerts" --method PUT
  ```

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Enable **private vulnerability reporting**.

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/private-vulnerability-reporting" --method PUT
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** Install and activate the **Renovate** GitHub App —
      install <https://github.com/apps/renovate> for **Only select
      repositories** and select this repo. In the Mend Developer Portal choose
      the **Renovate** product and **Scan and Alert** mode. **Scan Only** is
      silent mode: it scans without checks, issues (including the Dependency
      Dashboard), or update/remediation PRs. Keep the generated
      `renovate.json`; do not replace it with a generic onboarding config.

- [ ] **[human-only; only when `use_codex_cloud_review=true`]** Confirm the
      maintainer's ChatGPT plan has Codex cloud-review availability, connect the
      Codex GitHub integration, and grant it access to this repository. Private
      repositories require an explicit connector permission; do not infer access
      from local Codex CLI authentication. Disable **Codex Automatic reviews**:
      the draft-workbench lifecycle uses explicit `@codex review` cycles, and
      marking a clean draft ready must not start a second asynchronous review.
      Three knobs, all of them: personal **Auto review** off, the repository's
      **Auto code review** preference on **Follow personal**, and the
      repository's review **Trigger** on Follow personal too — an "On every
      push" trigger is dormant while Auto review is off, and arms across every
      Follow-personal repo the moment the personal toggle changes.
      GitHub exposes no reliable repository API for that setting, so record the
      human confirmation rather than reporting it as mechanically verified. On
      a draft PR, post `@codex review` and verify the generated shepherd
      classifier accepts an authenticated terminal result for that exact PR head
      before treating setup as complete.

- [ ] **[human-only; only when `use_coderabbit=true`]** Install the
      **CodeRabbit** GitHub App — <https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai>. The
      generated `.coderabbit.yaml` must set
      `reviews.auto_review.drafts: true` so its required review settles before
      ready-for-review triggers the human handoff. Verify that value before
      connecting the App. A generated `false` means the selected harmon-init
      release predates the draft lifecycle; upgrade it rather than promoting a
      PR early to trigger CodeRabbit.

- [ ] **[human-only; default `use_coderabbit=false`]** Confirm CodeRabbit has no
      access to this repository. For a repository that previously used it,
      remove the repo from the CodeRabbit GitHub App installation after Copier
      removes `.coderabbit.yaml`; deleting the config alone does not revoke App
      access.

- [ ] **[human-only]** Set Actions **secret** `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
      (consumed by `claude-plan.yml`, `claude-implement.yml`,
      `claude-review.yml`). This is a real credential the agent must not invent;
      a human generates it with `claude setup-token` and pastes it. It **must**
      start `sk-ant-oat01-` (an OAuth token billed to the Claude **subscription**)
      — **not** `sk-ant-api03-` (a raw API key billed at pay-as-you-go **API
      rates**, an easy and expensive mix-up). Once you have it:

  ```bash
  # human supplies the token value; do not fabricate it
  gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --repo "<org>/<repo>"
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only decision; optional]** Choose the Snyk posture recorded by
      `<snyk_scan_schedule>`:

  - `off` (default): keep Snyk manual/local through
    `task security:sast:snyk` and `task security:sca:snyk`, with `SNYK_TOKEN`
    in the local environment or 1Password. Do not create an Actions secret.
  - `weekly` or `daily`: the generated advisory `snyk-scheduled.yml` runs SAST
    and SCA only on its schedule or manual dispatch—never PR/push and never as a
    required branch check. Set the secret, run it once manually, and inspect the
    Snyk Organization Usage page:

    ```bash
    # human supplies the existing Snyk token value
    gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN --repo "<org>/<repo>"
    gh workflow run snyk-scheduled.yml --repo "<org>/<repo>"
    ```

  Prefer `weekly` as the conservative cadence. `daily` is intended for public
  repositories or projects accepted into Snyk's
  [unlimited open-source program](https://snyk.io/open-source/).
  Confirm Snyk classifies a public Git remote correctly and does not debit the
  private-test allocation; if it does, follow Snyk's
  [documented remedy](https://docs.snyk.io/developer-tools/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli#running-out-of-tests):
  run `snyk monitor` once and set the Project's Git remote URL in Snyk. Free
  private repositories keep Semgrep CE in CI and normally use Snyk only for
  occasional local scans because local and
  scheduled private tests share the Organization-wide quota. Leave the Snyk
  GitHub App off unless deliberately adopting its PR integration; its checks are
  not required by the default ruleset. Important private repositories may
  instead evaluate paid GitHub Code Security/private CodeQL and/or paid Snyk.

- [ ] **[human-only]** Create or reuse the CI **GitHub App** `<org>-ci`, then
      set `CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` (Actions **variable**) + `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (Actions
      **secret**). This App authenticates `release.yml` (release-please) and the
      `claude-*` workflows; minting an App-authored commit is what lets a release
      PR's required checks actually run (the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not
      retrigger CI).

  **One App per org** (or per personal account) — `<org>-ci`, e.g.
  `evanharmon1-ci` — so a leaked key is contained to one org. The App must be
  created in the GitHub UI: the app-manifest "one-click" flow can't be completed
  by a static page (the one-time `?code=` expires), so this is human-only. The
  exact permission set is checked into the generated repo as
  `.github/github-app-manifest.json`; mirror it in the form.

  - New GitHub App: org → `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/new`;
    personal → `https://github.com/settings/apps/new`.
  - Name `<org>-ci`; uncheck the **Active** webhook; **"Only on this account"**;
    grant exactly these permissions and nothing more:

    | Permission | Level | Why |
    |---|---|---|
    | Contents | Read and write | commits, branches, tags, releases |
    | Pull requests | Read and write | open/update the release PR and claude PRs |
    | Issues | Read and write | claude comments/labels/updates issues |
    | Workflows | Read and write | claude may edit files under `.github/workflows/` |
    | Metadata | Read-only | required baseline |

  - Generate a private key (`.pem`) and copy the **Client ID** (the Iv-style string on the App's settings page, not the numeric App ID).
  - **Install App** → on this org → **Only select repositories** (not "All").
    **Creating the App is not enough:** an App with credentials set but *not
    installed* on the repo makes `actions/create-github-app-token` fail at runtime
    with a **404** (`Not Found`). This is the single easiest step to miss.
  - Set the variable + secret. **Scope the secret least-privilege** to the repos
    that use the App (`--visibility selected --repos`), not the whole org — the key
    can act as the App (commits, PRs, releases, workflow edits). **Pipe the `.pem`
    in**, never paste it (flattened newlines break the key):

    ```bash
    # org — scope to the repos where the App is installed
    gh secret set CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --org <org> \
      --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> < path/to/app.pem
    gh variable set CI_APP_CLIENT_ID --org <org> \
      --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> --body "<client-id>"

    # personal account — per-repo
    gh secret set CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --repo "<org>/<repo>" < path/to/app.pem
    gh variable set CI_APP_CLIENT_ID --repo "<org>/<repo>" --body "<client-id>"
    ```

    Caveat: re-running `--repos` **replaces** the list (evicting repos not in it) —
    re-run with the full list to add a repo, or append one with `gh api --method PUT
    /orgs/<org>/actions/secrets/CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY/repositories/{repo_id}`.

  > **Free-org caveat:** org-level Actions variables/secrets only reach **private**
  > repos on GitHub **Team/Enterprise**. On a **Free** org they read *empty* in a
  > private repo's workflows — a silent failure (e.g. an empty `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
  > made Terraform plan a resource *replacement*). On a Free org, set org-wide values
  > (including `CI_APP_*`) **per-repo** instead. Public repos are unaffected.

  See `docs/architecture/security.md` for blast-radius and rotation notes.

- [ ] **[human-only entitlement decision; scriptable via gh]** Confirm the
      visibility-appropriate SAST route. Repositories with `use_codeql=true`
      analyze exactly `codeql_languages`; public repositories run that workflow
      automatically and for free—confirm a successful Security-tab upload; do
      not set a variable. Private repositories with CodeQL disabled use Semgrep
      CE in `build.yml`, as do all repositories with `use_codeql=false`. Only
      after enabling GitHub Code Security for a private/internal repository, opt
      it into private CodeQL and confirm the upload:

  ```bash
  gh variable set FULL_SECURITY_SCAN --repo "<org>/<repo>" --body "true"
  ```

  The variable is a run switch, not an entitlement, and cannot disable public
  CodeQL. A generated workflow or a true variable by itself does not establish
  coverage; require a successful analysis/upload on every route where CodeQL is
  required.

- [ ] **[scriptable]** (Terraform repos) Prove the advertised lint and provider
      lock contract rather than relying on docs or a pre-existing lock file.
      `task --dry lint:terraform` and `task --dry check` must both reach fmt,
      TFLint, pinned Checkov, and `terraform-provider-locks.sh check`; the root
      Brewfile and build workflow must provision Terraform/TFLint/uv. Run the
      hermetic provider-lock regression, then use the explicit
      `task terraform:providers:lock` mutation task when provider requirements
      exist. Its helper targets both `darwin_arm64` and `linux_amd64`, passes
      `-upgrade` to scratch init only in update mode, and leaves it off in check
      mode; a fresh provider-free scaffold may skip without creating
      `.terraform.lock.hcl`.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (devcontainer projects) Ensure the org/user **allows
      GHCR package publishing** so the first `devcontainer-build.yml` prebuild on
      merge to main can populate `ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>-devcontainer`. The
      workflow already requests `packages: write` and logs in with
      `GITHUB_TOKEN`; org package-creation policy is a UI setting.

### Project management (when `project_management: github`)

Both owner types — the org-only follow-ups are in the next section.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Create/sync the owner's default **Project V2**. The
      generated repo ships an idempotent task; run it (needs the `project` scope —
      `gh auth refresh -s project`):

  ```bash
  task setup:github-project
  ```

  > It looks the project up by title and can be run from any of the owner's repos
  > (the first run creates it, later runs only reconcile). **Title lookup is not
  > identity**, though: it takes the first match and creates a new board when
  > nothing matches, then overwrites `ORG_PROJECT_ID` with whatever it picked. If
  > the owner already has boards — a renamed one, duplicate titles, or an obsolete
  > closed board holding the canonical title — run the identity preflight in
  > [`mode-update.md`](./mode-update.md) §6a **first**. On a genuinely fresh owner
  > with no boards, creation is the expected outcome and there is nothing to check.
  > It seeds the full `Status` pipeline plus the **`Size`** number
  > field — `Size` is the numeric estimate, because only project number fields sum
  > in view group headers — and never deletes existing options or fields.
  > **On an org** it also records the project id in the `ORG_PROJECT_ID` org
  > variable that `project-automation.yml` and the `claude-*` workflows read
  > (falling back to the project's title), so it no longer has to be the org's
  > project number 1; the remaining metadata are org *issue* fields (next
  > section), where Priority/Effort and the date fields are GitHub built-ins left
  > at their defaults. **On a personal account** there are no issue fields at all
  > (they are org-only, so no Priority/Effort/date built-ins either) — the script
  > instead creates Priority/Product/Agent/Domain/Layer as project fields, and
  > `Status` automation is a separate follow-up: the board exists, but issue/PR
  > status is not auto-synced. For the exact GraphQL (or to run it by hand), see
  > `scripts/setup-github-project.sh`.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI; personal accounts]** Customize the **`Domain`**
      options in the Project UI — the script seeds `auth`/`billing`/`platform`
      only, so add this product's real domains (from your ERD entities). `Layer`
      (`ui`/`logic`/`data`/`integration`) is product-independent and normally needs
      no edits. A re-run appends any missing *starter* option, but never your
      repo-specific ones and never a **removal** — retiring an option is manual
      too, and only after re-mapping (deleting an assigned option clears those
      values). Org repos do this in the org's issue-field settings instead (next
      section).

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Seed this repo's **labels** — the five starter
      families (concerns / source / workflow / `layer:` / `domain:`). Labels are
      **per-repo** (there is no shared org label pool), so run it in every repo:

  ```bash
  task setup:github-labels
  ```

  > Create-or-update (`--force`); it never deletes, so pruning GitHub's defaults —
  > or a pre-`ui`/`logic`/`data`/`integration` repo's stale `layer:frontend`,
  > `layer:backend`, `layer:infra` labels — stays manual. Whenever you add a
  > `domain:` option, add it to `scripts/setup-github-labels.sh` **and re-run this
  > task**: editing the script alone does not touch the live labels.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Create the project's **starter views** — **Board**,
      **Triage**, **Agent queue**, **Planning**, **Mine**. Projects V2 has no view
      API, so no task can do this and re-running the setup tasks will not create
      them. The filter and layout for each view are in the generated repo's
      `docs/project-management.md`; keep the saved set small and slice the one
      board for everything else.

  > **`Triage` cannot be built exactly as specified** — build the closest
  > workable form and move on. Its spec groups by **`Type`**, which is an
  > org-level issue field a personal account does not have, and filters on
  > "missing a `Priority`" **or** `needs-triage`, a union across two qualifiers
  > that Projects cannot express (distinct qualifiers AND). On a personal
  > account, group by something you do have (`Priority`); either way pick one
  > half of the filter and know the other half of the inbox is not in this view.
  > Tracked upstream as evanharmon1/harmon-init#444.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Turn on the project's built-in **"Auto-add to
      project"** workflow — this is what puts **every** issue and PR on the board.
      In the Project's **Settings → Workflows**, enable *Auto-add to project*,
      point it at this repo, and set the filter to `is:open`.

  > It is GitHub's native built-in — no Actions, no tokens — and the only
  > mechanism that catches an item however it was created. A repo that skips it
  > silently never reaches the project however completely the rest of this
  > section was followed, and (on an org) `project-automation.yml` then has no
  > items whose `Status` it can sync. Four things the UI will not warn you about:
  >
  > - **Filter qualifiers AND together**, so `is:issue is:pr` matches *nothing*.
  >   Leave the type unqualified — `is:open` alone already matches both issues
  >   and PRs, which is what the board wants.
  > - **One workflow targets one repo.** Every repo feeding the board needs its
  >   own auto-add workflow: add a new one, never re-point an existing repo's, or
  >   that repo silently stops feeding the board.
  > - **It does not backfill.** Existing items are never added — the workflow
  >   fires only when an item is created or updated afterwards. Adopting an
  >   existing repo, add the current backlog to the project by hand, or the board
  >   reads as complete while the backlog is missing.
  > - **The workflows are capped per project** — 1 on Free, 5 on Pro/Team, 20 on
  >   Enterprise. "Every repo feeds the one board" holds only under that cap, and
  >   **no fallback is specified here** — past it, treat board coverage as
  >   knowingly incomplete rather than assumed. This is not a gap to close on the
  >   spot with an `actions/add-to-project` workflow: the repo `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  >   has no Projects permission, and although the bot PAT now grants Projects
  >   write for org repos, routing that org-scoped token into a workflow is a
  >   deliberate blast-radius decision, not a default — and fork-PR coverage
  >   would still require a fork-influenced trigger, which the CI App key must
  >   never be read
  >   from (`docs/architecture/security.md`: not fork `pull_request`, not
  >   `pull_request_target`, not `workflow_run`). Design it deliberately, or
  >   accept the gap; do not improvise it here. The issue-form `projects:` key is
  >   not a substitute either: it covers only form-created issues and hard-codes
  >   a project number.

### Org repos only (`github_org != author_git_provider_username`)

The first two items apply only when `project_management: github` — the
issue-field task is rendered for `github` **and** an org owner, so an org repo
answering `linear`/`none` has no such task and should skip them.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh; `project_management: github` only]** Add the org
      **issue fields**. Needs `gh` with the `admin:org` scope
      (`gh auth refresh -s admin:org`):

  ```bash
  task setup:github-issue-fields
  ```

  > Adds the org's **Product**, **Agent**, **Domain**, and **Layer** issue fields
  > (public preview). Idempotent and additive: an existing field keeps every
  > option it has and gains any missing *starter* one, and nothing is ever
  > removed. It warns and exits 0 rather than failing when it cannot reconcile a
  > field — wrong data type (GitHub cannot change a type in place, and deleting
  > the field destroys every issue's value for it org-wide: **rename** it in the
  > org's issue-field settings, re-run to create the correctly-typed replacement,
  > migrate the values, and only then delete the original), option cap reached,
  > or a `PATCH` the preview rejected — so read the WARNING lines rather than
  > trusting the exit code.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI; `project_management: github` only]** Customize the
      **`Domain`** options. The script
      seeds `auth`/`billing`/`platform` only — add this product's real domains
      (from your ERD entities) in the org's issue-field settings. The field is
      org-wide while labels are per-repo, so each repo carries the `domain:` labels
      for the domains it actually uses: add those to
      `scripts/setup-github-labels.sh` and re-run `task setup:github-labels` in
      that repo. `Layer` (`ui`/`logic`/`data`/`integration`) is product-independent
      and normally needs no edits. A re-run appends any missing *starter* option,
      but never your repo-specific ones and never a **removal** — retiring an
      option is manual too, and only after re-mapping (deleting an assigned option
      clears those values).

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Add the bot machine account
      (`<author_git_provider_username>-bot`) as a **Write** collaborator (it does
      the in-container git pushes; it cannot merge `main`):

  ```bash
  gh api "repos/<org>/<repo>/collaborators/<author_git_provider_username>-bot" \
    --method PUT -f permission=push
  ```

  > The grant is only half of it — see the PAT step below. Skipping that leaves
  > the bot with access it cannot use.

- [ ] **[manual — GitHub UI]** Add this repo to the bot's **fine-grained PAT**,
      under *Repository access → Only select repositories*. There is no API for
      creating or editing a PAT. Signed in **as the bot**: **Settings → Developer
      settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens**.

  > **Effective access = min(collaborator grant, PAT permissions).** A PAT
  > delegates its owner's access and can never exceed it, and its permission set
  > is *uniform across every selected repo* — there is no per-repo matrix. So
  > per-repo granularity lives in the **collaborator grant**, not the token: to
  > narrow the bot on a repo, change the grant. Both layers are required, in
  > order — a repo missing from the list fails even though the grant exists.
  >
  > **A PAT is scoped to one resource owner.** A token for
  > `<author_git_provider_username>` cannot reach `<org>/…`, so a **new org needs
  > a new PAT**, not a new entry. Pick the org as *Resource owner*, or its repos
  > are unreachable regardless of permissions.
  >
  > **Organization permissions are org-scoped — the selected-repo list does not
  > bound them.** A repository permission stops at the repos you selected; an
  > organization permission reaches every project and variable in the org,
  > including repos deliberately left off that list. Grant **Variables:
  > Read-only**. For an org repo using GitHub project management, grant
  > **Projects: Read and write** deliberately — so the claim lifecycle can move
  > cards through the `Status` pipeline (a personal-account repo grants no
  > Projects permission at all; that row is org-scoped). The cost is that a
  > compromised token can write to every board the org owns, not just this
  > repo's; revisit the day the org holds a repo the bot should not see. Read
  > is cheap; write is the line — and Projects crosses it deliberately.

## 3. Framework scaffolding (conventions-only template)

The template ships conventions, not an application. Scaffold the framework that
matches `<project_type>`:

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`web-astro`) Scaffold Astro and add the standard
      stack. **Scaffold BEFORE the first push** when the repo deploys to Cloudflare
      Workers: the pre-push hook runs `astro check`, which fails on a bare repo with
      no app — so scaffold on a branch, fast-forward it into `main`, *then*
      `gh repo create --push` (never `--no-verify`).

  ```bash
  pnpm create astro@latest . --template minimal
  pnpm add -D @tailwindcss/vite vitest
  pnpm add @astrojs/react react react-dom   # if using React islands (the standard stack)
  pnpm add zod lucide
  # install the plugins the shipped eslint.config.js + prettier config expect:
  pnpm add -D eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint eslint-plugin-astro globals
  pnpm add -D prettier prettier-config-standard prettier-plugin-astro prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
  ```

  Then move lint tooling (prettier, eslint, markdownlint-cli2, @commitlint/cli)
  into `devDependencies` and switch the generated `Taskfile.yml`'s `npx --yes`
  calls to `pnpm exec`. Review `lighthouserc.json` URLs once routes exist.

  Build-script approvals + the esbuild security floor already ship in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`allowBuilds: esbuild, sharp`, plus `workerd` when
  deploying to Workers; `overrides: esbuild >=0.28.1`) — add any other packages
  your deps need to `allowBuilds` (a pnpm 11+ setting — it replaced pnpm 10's
  `onlyBuiltDependencies`, so the shipped file needs pnpm 11+), not the
  `package.json` `pnpm` field (pnpm 10+ ignores it).

  > **Cloudflare Workers deploy:** bootstrap the Worker **once** before PR
  > previews work. A preview (`wrangler versions upload`) requires the Worker to
  > already exist, so run the production deploy first (Actions → *Release Please*
  > → *Run workflow* on `main`). See the generated `docs/guides/deploying.md`.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`web-app`) Scaffold a TanStack Start app (or
      vite + react) and add the standard stack:

  ```bash
  pnpm create @tanstack/start@latest   # or: pnpm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
  pnpm add -D vitest
  pnpm add zod lucide
  # shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 per their installers, e.g.:
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
  ```

  Move lint tooling into `devDependencies` and switch Taskfile `npx --yes` calls
  to `pnpm exec`.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`iac`) Lay out the IaC tree. Lint tasks for
      Ansible activate automatically once `ansible/site.yml` exists:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p terraform ansible/inventory ansible/roles
  : > terraform/main.tf
  : > terraform/variables.tf
  : > terraform/outputs.tf
  : > ansible/site.yml
  : > ansible/ansible.cfg
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** (`docs`) Decide the docs toolchain (plain markdown /
      Obsidian vault / static-site generator) — a judgment call, not scripted.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** (`general` / anything else) Add the project's
      primary toolchain and extend the Taskfile `build`/`test` targets
      accordingly.

## 4. Secrets & environment

- [ ] **[human-only]** For local `.env` needs, use **1Password Environments**
      (mounts a virtual `.env` over a UNIX pipe — values never hit disk or git)
      or `op run` / `op inject`. Commit only `.env.example`-style files.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (devcontainer projects) Devcontainer secrets: create a
      **1Password environment** with destination "Local .env file" mounted at
      `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (and `.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.env`),
      holding `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY`
      (+ `TS_AUTHKEY` for the dev profile; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is forbidden).
      `init-env.sh` only enforces the per-profile allow-list and seeds from the
      **host env** (the Coder/Codespaces path) — it does **not** call `op`. Full
      walkthrough in the generated repo's `docs/guides/devcontainers.md`.

- [ ] **[human-only]** (Coder) To run the devcontainer in Coder, create a
      workspace from the **org-level Coder devcontainer template** (not part of
      the repo — canonical example: `terraform/coder/devcontainer/` in
      harmonops/harmon-infra) with its `repo` parameter set to this repo and the
      secret parameters above (Coder passes them as host env → `init-env.sh`).
      The build pulls `<devcontainer_image>` from GHCR as a cache (private
      package ⇒ give the builder a read token; a miss only slows the first build).

## 5. Docs & meta

- [ ] **[human-only]** Fill in the `TODO:` markers in `README.md` and `docs/`
      (architecture diagram first) — authoring, not scripting.

- [ ] **[scriptable via gh]** Confirm README badges render once CI has run
      (Actions URLs become valid after the first workflow run):

  ```bash
  gh run list --repo "<org>/<repo>" --limit 5
  ```

- [ ] **[human-only]** Cut the initial release when ready — releases stay
      **intentional**, never automated on merge:

  ```bash
  task release:init   # v0.1.0
  ```
