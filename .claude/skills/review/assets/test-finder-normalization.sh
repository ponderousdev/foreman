# Two obligations, both from #796:
#
#   1. every registered finder has a fixture of its OWN raw output shape that
#      decodes to a pinned pass core;
#   2. the shared consumers — adjudication, the exit computation, the
#      renderer — contain no finder-specific branch, which is the whole point
#      of decoding here instead of there.
