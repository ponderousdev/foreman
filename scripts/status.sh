# ── Local credentials ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The logins the Dev Loop gates on, read from LOCAL state only — no API call and
# no network — so this renders in any auth state and costs nothing.
#
# It is a section of its own AND a group inside the setup audit, from this one
# function so the probes are written once. Two callers, two reasons:
#
#   * `task status:creds` — the session-start hook runs it alongside status:git
#     and status:gh, so a missing login is reported when a session opens rather
#     than only on the explicit `task status:setup` a distracted session skips.
#     That is the whole point: the audit it used to live in is network-heavy and
#     excluded from the default board, while these probes are not.
#   * `task status:setup` — rendered BEFORE the gh gate there rather than inside
#     it. That gate skips the ENTIRE remaining audit when gh is logged out, so a
#     credentials group living there would surface a missing codex login only
#     after the reader had fixed gh and re-run: two round trips to learn what one
#     run can say, which is the interruption this group exists to remove.
#
# `should_show` also puts it on the bare `task status` board, alongside every
# other local section. The setup audit stays off that board because it is
# network-heavy; this group is not, so the reason to exclude it does not apply.
#
# Every probe here is bounded by the short LOCAL bound (3s), never by
# NETWORK_TIMEOUT — the session-start path must not inherit a cost its budget
# was not derived for.
#
# ONE of them reaches the network: the gh token's SCOPES (render_gh_scope_check
# below). That is not a local fact — no file on disk records it — and issue
# #827 needs it at session start, so the section spends exactly one bounded 3s
# call for it and nothing else. It is capped at the LOCAL bound rather than
# NETWORK_TIMEOUT for the same budget reason as everything else here: the hook
# budgets this section from the sum of these bounds (13s, both hook copies),
# and a section that overruns loses ALL of its buffered output. Set
# `STATUS_NO_NETWORK=1` to drop that one probe and make the section local-only
# again. Anything else added here must stay local.
# render_gh_scope_check — one ⚠/unknown line when the authenticated token is
# missing a scope this repo's tooling needs, and NOTHING when it has them all.
#
# Silent-on-success is a deliberate exception to this script's usual
# report-both-directions rule (issue #827's acceptance criterion). The rule
# exists so a check that never runs cannot masquerade as a passing one — and
# here the caller has already printed a ✓ line for the same credential from the
# same probe, so the evidence that this ran is on screen either way. A second
# green line on every session start, in every repo, would be pure noise.

# captured where there is one; standalone (`status:creds`) it makes the single
