# readiness-gate.sh — hard-enforce every step-6 readiness condition before
# `gh pr ready`.
#
# The readiness gate is the one-way door of the shepherd lifecycle: promotion
# notifies CODEOWNERS and requested reviewers, and `gh pr ready --undo` cannot
# unsend that. A hand-assembled gate enforces exactly the conditions its
# author remembered to guard that day — a session-authored one printed failing
# checks in its snapshot and promoted anyway (harmon-devkit#384) — so this
# script wires every condition to an exit code. Nothing is printed-and-passed:
# the first failed condition exits non-zero naming it, and only a full pass
# prints the promotion content fingerprint.
#
# This helper never writes to GitHub. The caller owns `gh pr ready`.
#
# Usage:
#   readiness-gate.sh check --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --head SHA
#       --record DIR --integrator-result FILE --integration-cap N
#       [--codex-recheck STATE_FILE] [--allow-edited-root ID]...
#   readiness-gate.sh audit --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --head SHA
#       --record DIR --integrator-result FILE --integration-cap N
#       [--codex-recheck STATE_FILE] [--allow-edited-root ID]...
#   readiness-gate.sh fingerprint --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
#
# `check` evaluates the gate for the adjudicated 40-hex head SHA and, on full
# pass only, prints `{"status":"pass",...,"fingerprint":...}` — where the
# fingerprint is double-read: computed over the exact content the conditions
# judged, then re-fetched fresh and required identical (`content-moved`
# otherwise), so a mid-gate edit fails before promotion notifies anyone.
# `audit` is the same evaluation with the draft requirement inverted (its
# target must be non-draft — it judges an existing promotion): it answers
# "does this head independently pass everything else" for a PR somebody
# already promoted — §2's unexplained-promotion reconcile branch and §6's
# already-non-draft audit run it instead of hand-rolling the evidence — and
# its pass never authorizes `gh pr ready`; only a passing `check` does.
# `fingerprint` recomputes the same five-surface content fingerprint with no
# gate attached — it is the post-promotion read the caller compares against
# `check`'s value.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  pass — every condition held; the fingerprint is on stdout
#   1  fail — a readiness condition is definitively not met
#   2  indeterminate — a fetch failed, data is malformed, GitHub has not
#      populated an answer yet, or the arguments are unusable. Unknown never
#      passes: 2 is "re-poll or reconcile", never "promote".
#
# `check` emits one JSON line naming the decisive condition:
#   pr-not-open, pr-not-draft, head-mismatch, head-moved   (fail)
#   checks-failing, checks-pending                          (fail)
#   changes-requested, merge-state-dirty, merge-state-behind (fail)
#   threads-unanswered, threads-new-follow-up,
#   threads-edited-since-reply                              (fail)
#   deferred-unsettled                                       (fail)
#   codex-not-clean, disposition-unsettled,
#   unresolved-integrator-findings                          (fail)
#   checks-indeterminate, merge-state-unknown, fetch-failed,
#   malformed-data, codex-indeterminate, codex-cap-mismatch,
#   codex-stale, usage                                      (indeterminate)
#
# Two readiness conditions are deliberately NOT verified here, because no
# API answers them — the caller must hold them as prose prerequisites:
#   - required automation that reacts only to `pull_request.ready_for_review`
#     (a configuration blocker: promotion would notify humans before its
#     result exists);
#   - a required context that NEVER REGISTERED on this head. The checks
#     condition judges every check GitHub reports for the commit; a required
#     workflow that failed to trigger appears in no list, and the only state
#     that encodes it — merge-blockedness — must stay promotable (BLOCKED is
#     the expected pre-review state). "Every required workflow actually ran"
#     is §6's automation-coverage condition, held by the caller.
# Nor does a pass certify adjudication QUALITY: the gate re-checks the
# mechanical surfaces (reply linkage, deferred ticks, review decision) and
# freezes the rest into the fingerprint, but a top-level finding posted after
# the caller's last watch round is frozen, not adjudicated — the caller's §2
# watch owes it, exactly as it did under the hand-run recipe this replaces. A
# human still reads the PR.
#
# Toward the local filesystem and GitHub alike, the gate itself writes
# nothing: --integrator-result is a FILE the caller already has (the
# dispatched integrator agent's own schema-valid result.envelope, role
# integrator — see ai/agents/integrator.md and result.integrator.schema.json).
# --record DIR is the dev-flow-v2 record directory render-dev-flow.mjs reads
# to project current deferred-finding settlement (readiness-input), also
# read-only — and the source of the active run's own identity: this script
# reads --record's run.json for run_id/initiated_by and binds the envelope
# to them (specs/dev-flow-v2.md:177-185), so evidence produced by a
# superseded or resumed run that happens to present the same head is refused
# rather than accepted on head equality alone.
#
# --codex-recheck STATE_FILE is the one place this script re-invokes a
# helper against live state: a cached codex_cycle can go stale between the
# dispatched integrator pass that produced --integrator-result and this gate
# running — a badged Codex finding posted as a top-level comment or review
# body in that window has no reply linkage and outranks a cached clean
# result on the same head (AGENTS.md's terminal-result contract), yet
# nothing about --integrator-result's own schema validity changes when that
# happens. Rather than re-deriving that classification here — the file's own
# stance a few paragraphs up ("classification belongs to the agent and the
# checker it runs") — a clean exit_code 0 is reconfirmed by re-invoking
# check-codex-cloud-review.sh's own `check` subcommand, read-only, against
# STATE_FILE: the same sibling asset and the same on-disk state the
# dispatched integrator agent itself drove (ai/agents/integrator.md §4),
# never a state file this script creates or owns. `check` takes only a
# transient advisory lock beside STATE_FILE (mkdir/rmdir, non-blocking) and,
# for a state file already carrying a persisted timeout_min — every state
# file a current integrator run produces — writes nothing else; it is not
# exempt from the "gate writes nothing" claim above, only the one caller
# that legitimately re-runs another script's read path instead of reading a
# file directly. Omitting the flag skips this one extra guard, exactly like
# --integration-cap below, rather than assuming freshness of any particular
# kind — but every real caller (ai/skills/universal/integrate/SKILL.md's own
# §6) always supplies it.

Usage:
  readiness-gate.sh check --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --head SHA
      --record DIR --integrator-result FILE --integration-cap N
      --remediation-cap N [--codex-recheck STATE_FILE]

  readiness-gate.sh audit --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --head SHA

  readiness-gate.sh fingerprint --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N

check evaluates every step-6 readiness condition for the adjudicated head;
audit is the same evaluation with the draft requirement inverted (the PR
must be non-draft), for judging a PR somebody already promoted — its pass
never authorizes gh pr ready.
fingerprint recomputes the five-surface content fingerprint for the
post-promotion compare. --record DIR is the dev-flow-v2 record directory
(run.json plus adjudications/*.json) render-dev-flow.mjs projects deferred-
finding settlement from, and this script separately reads run.json's own
settlements[] from for the applied-disposition check below.
--integrator-result FILE is the dispatched integrator agent's schema-valid
result.envelope (role integrator) for this exact head; its payload's
codex_cycle carries the current-head Codex verdict when the resolved
integration cap is not 0, or is null when it is — a null codex_cycle is how
the Codex condition is waived, so there is no separate disabled flag. Both
--record and --integrator-result are always required; there is no mode
where either is skippable. The envelope is also bound to the active run
before anything else about it is trusted (specs/dev-flow-v2.md:177-185): this
script reads --record's own run.json for run_id/initiated_by and passes them
to the schema validator as --run-id/--initiated-by, so a schema-valid
envelope whose own .run disagrees — evidence from a superseded or resumed
run that happens to present the same head — is refused exactly like a
malformed one, never silently accepted on head equality alone.
--integration-cap N is required (harmon-devkit#685; made mandatory rather
than advisory in harmon-devkit#639 gauntlet challenge round 3): it enforces
that a cap of 0 pairs only with a null codex_cycle, that a positive cap
pairs only with a non-null one, and that codex_cycle.cycle never exceeds it
— the resolved value is the caller's (this script does not read
.devflow.toml), but the caller always has it, resolved early in its own
process, so there is no legitimate case for omitting it: a null codex_cycle
with the flag missing used to be silently trusted as proof the resolved cap
was 0, when it was really just the integrator's own unverified claim.
--remediation-cap N is required, for the same reason --integration-cap is
(harmon-devkit#685, challenge round 1): each integration -> implement ->
integration loop the record's own stage_transitions[] records is one
remediation round, and the count may not exceed the cap. Left optional, a
caller that simply omitted the flag would skip the policy check entirely and
an over-cap run would still promote — enforcement is not something a caller
opts into. The resolved value is the caller's (this script does not read
.devflow.toml), and the same resolution that yields --integration-cap yields
this one.
--codex-recheck STATE_FILE is optional and, when codex_cycle reports a clean
exit_code 0, re-confirms it read-only by re-running check-codex-cloud-
review.sh's own `check` against STATE_FILE (the same on-disk state the
dispatched integrator agent drove) rather than trusting a result that may
have gone stale since. Omitting it skips this one extra guard — unlike
--integration-cap, this one remains advisory, since resuming it needs an
on-disk state file that can genuinely be absent for operational reasons the
caller does not control; every real caller supplies it anyway.
--allow-edited-root ID clears an edited-since-reply line for that thread
root only — the named-exception rule: the caller's report must say why the
edit needs no reply.

    # A workflow triggering on pull_request.edited (this repo's two `guard`
    # jobs, one apiece in release-content-guard.yml and tracking-guard.yml)
    # starts a fresh check suite on every PR-body edit against an unchanged
    # head, so a superseded failure sits in the check-runs list alongside a
    # later success forever — the `filter=latest` above collapses runs only
    # WITHIN one check suite, never across the separate suites repeated
    # `pull_request` deliveries create (harmon-devkit#714, found shepherding
    # #713). Collapse to the newest run per (name, workflow, triggering
    # event), the same way the statuses group above collapses per context —
    # but keyed on the *workflow*, not the bare check-run name: this repo's
    # two guard jobs are both literally named "guard", and collapsing by name
    # alone would hide a live failure in one behind a stale success in the
    # other. The event is part of the key, not just the workflow, because a
    # workflow can answer more than one question on the same commit — this
    # repo's build.yml runs on `pull_request`, `push`, `merge_group`, AND
    # `workflow_dispatch` alike, and a manually dispatched success is not a
    # supersession of a failed PR-triggered run of the same job name; only
    # repeated deliveries of the SAME event genuinely re-ask the same
    # question. Workflow/event identity comes from joining each run's
    # check_suite.id against `actions/runs`, which is GitHub-Actions-only; a
    # check run from any other source (a third-party App) has no entry there
    # and falls back to its app id — an App outside Actions does not
    # multiply suites per edit, so a per-app collapse is a safe, conservative
    # default, not a workaround (deferred P2, harmon-devkit#714 challenge r1
    # and r2, re-raised shepherd r2: an App that DID reuse a name across
    # permanently-coexisting, non-superseding suites would still be
    # conflated by app id alone — and the same fallback is reached not only
    # by a genuinely non-Actions App, but also if `actions/runs` ever omits
    # a suite that a real GitHub Actions workflow produced (no confirmed
    # trigger for that on this repo; both paths share the one signal
    # available, `app.id`, and so share the one mitigation); no
    # currently-installed App on this repo produces check-runs at all besides
    # `github-actions`, so the gap is real but unreached, and resolving it
    # generally needs a redesign out of this bounded fix's scope, per #714's
    # own "out of scope" note pointing at #639).
    #
    # "Newest" is resolved per SUITE, by check_suite.id, not `started_at` and
    # not by picking a single highest-id run directly. check_suite.id is
    # assigned in delivery order and strictly increasing, while `started_at`
    # is when a runner picked the job up, which queuing can reorder relative
    # to delivery (and ties outright on two runs started in the same second)
    # — the exact trap the statuses dedup above already avoids by sorting on
    # id rather than a timestamp. Once the newest suite for an identity is
    # found, EVERY run belonging to it is kept, not just one: a workflow can
    # define two jobs that render the same display name (a matrix job with
    # no differentiating `name:`, or simply two job blocks that both
    # hard-code one), and both then land in the same suite under the same
    # _identity. Picking a single highest-id winner across the whole
    # identity group would keep one sibling and silently drop the other's
    # failure even though neither superseded the other — they are
    # simultaneous facts about the same delivery, not a history to collapse.
    # Every run from an older, truly superseded suite for that identity is
    # still dropped (harmon-devkit#714 challenge r2).
    # head_sha alone does not scope to THIS pr: the same commit can back
    # open PRs against more than one base branch, and this endpoint returns
    # every workflow run for the sha regardless of which PR it ran under
    # (harmon-devkit#714 challenge r3). A run's own `pull_requests[]`
    # narrows that, but not cleanly: GitHub populates it with EVERY currently
    # open PR whose head matches this sha, not the one that triggered the
    # run, so a run genuinely triggered by a sibling PR still lists ours
    # whenever both share the head — a same-PR-number membership test alone
    # cannot tell "definitely ours" from "shared, and this run might not be"
    # (harmon-devkit#714 review r1). Three cases, not two: an EMPTY list is
    # not evidence of exclusion (GitHub is known to leave it empty even for
    # a run that genuinely belongs to the PR being gated) and keeps the run
    # exactly as before this filter existed; whether this PR's own number is
    # anywhere IN the list is what decides the rest, not the list's length —
    # a list omitting it entirely is positive proof to exclude, whether it
    # names exactly one other PR or several (harmon-devkit#714 shepherd,
    # fixing an earlier version that treated any 2+-PR list as ambiguous
    # without checking whether this PR was even one of them); a list that
    # DOES include this PR alongside at least one other is genuinely
    # ambiguous and must never be trusted to CLEAR another run's failure,
    # because a sibling PR's base branch can make the identical commit
    # behave differently under base-relative workflow logic (the same
    # reasoning behind scoping runs to a PR at all). Such a
    # run is kept, since dropping it could hide a real failure that IS ours
    # — but review round 2 found kept was not enough on its own: (1) two
    # ambiguous suites for the same nominal workflow/event still shared one
    # `:shared-pr` identity, so a later ambiguous suite could still supersede
    # an earlier one — there is no confident basis for "later ambiguous
    # supersedes earlier ambiguous" any more than there was for "supersedes
    # this PR's own run", so an ambiguous run's identity now folds in its own
    # check_suite.id, making it permanently distinct from every other suite,
    # ambiguous or not; and (2) "other-pr" was excluded only from the
    # workflow-run lookup, not from `check_runs` itself, so its check run
    # still fell through to the app-id identity and — if it happened to be a
    # FAILURE — could still fail a PR it was never really testing. A
    # positively-other-PR check run is now dropped outright, before any
    # identity is computed, not merely disconnected from its metadata. The
    # current-head Codex cycle then found a further gap in the empty-list
    # case itself: TWO open PRs sharing a head sha can both get an empty
    # `pull_requests` from GitHub, in which case both runs read as
    # "unscoped" and collapse together with nothing to tell them apart
    # (harmon-devkit#714 shepherd, PR #723). `pull_requests[]` isn't the only
    # signal available, though — a run's own `head_branch` is, at no extra
    # fetch cost, and a run whose branch is NOT this PR's own branch is
    # excluded exactly like a positively-other-PR run, even when
    # `pull_requests` is empty. This still isn't complete (two PRs can share
    # one branch against different bases, in which case the names match and
    # nothing here would catch it — raised again as a P1 the very next
    # cycle and declined again for the same reason: no further signal is
    # available from this endpoint, closing it needs a mechanism this
    # bounded fix doesn't have, and it needs four simultaneous rare
    # conditions — shared head sha, shared branch, an empty pull_requests
    # from GitHub on top of that, AND base-relative workflow behavior — none
    # of which this repo's own workflows exhibit even one of), but it costs
    # nothing and narrows the common case of a differently named sibling
    # branch that happens to produce an identical tree. Every PR-ownership
    # judgment here — the branch check above, and "does pull_requests[]
    # include this PR" below — applies only to `pull_request`-triggered
    # runs: a `push` or `workflow_dispatch` run has no PR to belong to in
    # the first place (its `pull_requests[]`, when non-empty, is a
    # best-effort historical association GitHub attaches after the fact,
    # not evidence about what the run itself was testing), so judging it
    # against a branch name OR a PR number is the same category error
    # either way — confirmed reachable for the PR-number path too, not just
    # the branch path (harmon-devkit#714 shepherd r3): a stale
    # `pull_requests[]` naming only a sibling PR must not make a real
    # push/workflow_dispatch failure disappear. A missing `head_branch`
    # (some trigger types never set it) keeps the prior behavior —
    # unscoped, kept — rather than excluding on absence.
    #
    # A non-`pull_request` event's identity includes its own branch, not
    # just its workflow and event: the same commit pushed to two different
    # branches produces two independently significant answers, and without
    # the branch in the key both suites would render as the identical
    # `wf:<id>:push`, letting one branch's later success hide the other's
    # earlier failure (harmon-devkit#714 shepherd r3). `pull_request` runs
    # don't need this — the PR itself is already the scoping unit for those.

# content read" — a review, comment, body edit, or resolution change landing
# while the gate evaluated fails HERE, before `gh pr ready` notifies anyone,
# not merely in the post-promotion compare that undo cannot fully walk back.

# the head: a CHANGES_REQUESTED review landing mid-gate is absorbed into the
# reviews fingerprint (so the post-promotion compare would stay identical),
# and mergeability is excluded from the fingerprint by design — this re-read
# is the only thing that can catch either.
