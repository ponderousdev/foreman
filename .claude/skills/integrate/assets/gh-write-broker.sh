# gh-write-broker.sh — the integrator's only permitted GitHub writes, each
# validated to post EXACTLY one thing, nothing else configurable.
#
# specs/dev-flow-v2.md's role-write contract: "every permitted external write
# goes through a broker script that validates its one action" — this is that
# broker for the writes ai/agents/integrator.md §4 and §6 make: the
# `@codex review` trigger and an inline-thread reply. Unlike gh-ro.sh (a
# structurally read-only front door that vets and forwards a caller-chosen
# endpoint), this wrapper does not forward a caller-chosen body or endpoint
# shape at all — each subcommand has its own fixed endpoint template and its
# own narrow body source, so there is no argument that could turn "post this
# reply" into "post anything else."
#
# Deliberately NOT a subcommand here: posting a new top-level PR conversation
# comment. specs/dev-flow-v2.md's role-write table authorizes the integrator
# for exactly "the Codex trigger comment; thread replies of given text" —
# a top-level comment is neither; disposing a badged finding with no inline
# thread is the orchestrating skill's own `settle` write (ai/skills/
# universal/integrate/SKILL.md §2), never delegated to this agent (review
# round 2 gauntlet challenge, harmon-devkit#639: an earlier revision of this
# broker carried a `top-level` subcommand that exceeded that boundary).
#
# This script does not, by itself, restrict which tools the dispatching
# harness lets the integrator invoke (ai/agents/integrator.md carries no
# `tools:`/`allowed-tools:` frontmatter — see its own note on why, and on the
# open question that leaves for a harness that cannot enforce this at
# dispatch time). What it does mean: an integrator that follows its own
# instructions, rather than calling `gh api` directly, is mechanically
# narrower than the raw prefix — no method choice, no arbitrary endpoint, no
# arbitrary body beyond what each subcommand below accepts.
#
# Usage:
#   gh-write-broker.sh trigger --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
#       Posts the literal, hardcoded comment body "@codex review" to the PR's
#       top-level conversation and prints the created comment's {"id": N} —
#       the one trigger the Codex-cycle helper's reserve/attach state machine
#       expects. The body is not a parameter: there is no flag that changes
#       what gets posted here.
#   gh-write-broker.sh trigger --finder SLUG --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
#       Posts the finder's trigger body (from the trusted registry at the
#       PR's merge-base commit) to the PR. The body is resolved from the
#       registry, never from a caller flag — constraint C1.
#   gh-write-broker.sh request-review --finder SLUG --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
#       Requests the finder's reviewer login (from the trusted registry) as
#       a PR reviewer. For requested-reviewer finders (e.g. copilot-cloud).
#   gh-write-broker.sh reply --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --comment-id ID --body-file FILE
#       Posts FILE's exact byte content as a reply within that inline review
#       comment's thread.
#
# `reply` takes its body from a FILE, never a flag value or
# stdin freeform text — matching ai/agents/integrator.md §6's own file-based
# posting (never a heredoc: contributor-controlled review text can contain
# any line, including one that would terminate a heredoc early and hand the
# remainder to the shell). The file must exist and be non-empty; this script
# never synthesizes or edits its content.
#
# Exit codes: 2 for a refusal or usage error; otherwise `gh api`'s own.

Usage:
  gh-write-broker.sh trigger --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
  gh-write-broker.sh trigger --finder SLUG --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
  gh-write-broker.sh request-review --finder SLUG --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N
  gh-write-broker.sh reply --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --comment-id ID --body-file FILE

trigger (no --finder) posts the hardcoded "@codex review" body.
trigger --finder posts the finder's trigger body from the trusted registry.
request-review --finder requests the finder's reviewer from the trusted registry.
reply posts a FILE's exact byte content to one inline thread.
No subcommand accepts a caller-supplied body on the command line.
