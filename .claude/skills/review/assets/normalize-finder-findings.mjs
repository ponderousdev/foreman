// normalize-finder-findings.mjs — decode ONE finder's raw output into the
// shared pass core every stage consumer already understands.
//
// It decodes MACHINE-SHAPED output only — a GitHub review and its comments.
// A local-CLI finder's free text is deliberately NOT decoded here, and that is
// a boundary rather than a gap: `/review`'s own contract already says "the
// registry invocation is the role's evidence source, not itself a result
// envelope: the dispatched role binds that output to the supplied run, scope,
// round, slot, and producer identity and returns `result.challenger` or
// `result.reviewer`". Reading that text is the ROLE's job, with the judgement
// a parser does not have.
//
// An earlier revision did decode it, and could not converge. Loosening the
// rule turned narration into findings ("Reviewing branch changes against
// origin/main."); tightening it dropped real ones (an unbadged file-level
// finding, two badged findings on consecutive lines). That is the same failure
// family this repository already documents at length above `verdict_class` in
// integrate/assets/check-codex-cloud-review.sh — free text
// "is not a channel that can be parsed reliably" — and the fix there was the
// same one taken here: stop trying.
//
// A finder's `severity_map` still governs a local pass; the ROLE applies it.
//
// The point of this script is what it makes unnecessary. Adjudication,
// dev-flow-support/assets/dev-flow-exit.mjs and dev-flow-support/assets/render-dev-flow.mjs read
// `findings[]` — id, path, line, class, provenance, fingerprint, priority,
// recommended_disposition, evidence — and must never learn which product
// produced one. So every finder-shaped decision lives here and in that
// finder's own agent-registry.json entry (`raw_shape`, `severity_map`), and a
// new finder is a registry entry plus fixtures rather than a branch in three
// shared consumers.
//
// Usage:
//   normalize-finder-findings.mjs --finder <slug> --stage <challenge|review>
//       --round <n> --reviewed-head <sha40> [--slot <slug>]
//       [--registry <path>] [--input <file>]
//
// Raw output arrives on stdin unless --input names a file. The result is the
// pass core on stdout:
//
//   { stage, round, reviewed_head, finder, slot, substitutes_for?,
//     findings: [...], counts: {P0,P1,P2,P3} }
//
// For a review-stage finder that IS a complete, schema-valid
// result.reviewer payload. For a challenge-stage one it is that payload minus
// `attack_scenarios`, which is the challenger ROLE's own evidence (what it
// attempted, finding or not) and cannot be decoded from a finder's output —
// the role appends it before returning its envelope.
//
// Three fields are decoded conservatively ON PURPOSE, because the raw output
// does not carry them and inventing them would put an unverified assertion
// into evidence:
//
//   provenance   always `original`. The exit script verifies provenance
//                against the trusted history and downgrades to `round:N` with
//                recorded evidence; asserting a round here would be a claim
//                the decoder cannot support.
//   fingerprint  always `new`. `repeat-of` / `supersedes` needs the earlier
//                rounds' validated findings, which the dispatched role has in
//                its brief and this decoder does not.
//   class        derived from the decoded priority (P0/P1 correctness,
//                P2 hardening, P3 nit) unless the raw text states one
//                explicitly as `class: <value>`. A design-level finding is
//                one the role reclassifies with the evidence to do so.
//
// Exit: 0 decoded; 3 something could not be decoded; 2 usage or unreadable
// input. There is deliberately no flag to proceed past exit 3. An earlier
// revision had one, and it turned an undecodable P0 into a SUCCESSFUL empty
// pass — the finding reached stderr and nothing else, while the pass a stage
// banks is `findings[]`. A finding with no location cannot be represented at
// all (the shared schema requires `path`), so there is no honest "proceed
// anyway": decode it, or fix the input.

  // wording, and a top-level comment for a finder like `copilot-cloud` whose
  // profile lists only `review` and `inline`. Both produced a successful
  // empty slice.
