// dev-flow-exit.mjs — deterministic confidence-stage exit computation.
//
// Implements openspec/changes/dev-flow-v2/specs/exit-computation/spec.md and
// specs/dev-flow-v2.md § "Convergence model v0" over a run directory (see
// ai/schemas/README.md "Dev flow v2 exit computation: run directory layout"
// for the exact shape) plus a resolved .devflow.toml policy
// (devflow-policy.mjs).
//
// CLI:
//   node dev-flow-exit.mjs --run <dir> --stage <challenge|review> \
//     --policy <file> [--rigor <level>] [--merge-base-policy <file>] \
//     [--current-head <sha>] [--history <file> | --repo-root <dir>] \
//     [--heads <file>] [--closure <dir>] [--validator <path>]
//     [--verification-only] [--json]
//
// No --registry / --merge-base-registry / --task-targets here on purpose:
// exit computation reads the RESOLVED policy shape (rounds, convergence,
// stages), which never depends on registry/Taskfile cross-validation to be
// structurally complete — that check belongs entirely to `devflow-policy.mjs
// resolve`, run once, before a caller ever invokes this script (see
// ai/schemas/README.md).
//
// Exit codes: 0 continue, 20 converged, 21 diverging, 22 capped,
// 2 indeterminate, 1 usage/parse error.
//
// Every verdict that has a complete latest round also carries an additive
// `split_candidate` projection — the concentration/provenance evidence a
// blocker report needs to offer "split the mechanism out" beside "order more
// rounds" and "accept as spent" (specs/dev-flow-v2.md § The split strategy,
// issue #747). It is a diagnostic: no outcome, exit code, or cap depends on
// it, and it needs no policy knob.
//
// The --verification-only projection also carries an additive `rounds`
// array — the machine-readable trajectory a caller reports FROM instead of
// re-deriving round assembly itself via this module's own exported helpers
// (harmon-devkit#1001). The final (non-verification-only) verdict never
// carries this field: it is the projection review/SKILL.md's fenced public
// comment is built from, which must publish only verified/corrected
// provenance and fingerprint values, never a round's raw envelopes
// (integration cycle 2, confirmed — an earlier revision attached it there
// too). One entry per logical
// round assembled for `--stage`, from the FULL (pre-ancestry-filter)
// trajectory, in round order:
//   { round, status, reviewed_head, unresolved_slot, substitutions,
//     has_adjudication, adjudication, passes, blocked_passes, findings }
// `adjudication` is the raw adjudication document for this round, or null.
// `passes`/`blocked_passes` are `{name, envelope}` pairs — `passes` is every
// schema/receipt-valid pass naming this stage+round (not narrowed to
// whichever pass actually won a contested slot); `blocked_passes` is every
// on-disk envelope for this stage+round whose status is "blocked",
// UNFILTERED by receipt-backing (a caller that only trusts a receipted
// attempt restricts this itself — this module has no opinion on that). Each
// `findings[]` entry is `{id, adjudicated_priority, disposition,
// provenance_status, verified_provenance, fingerprint_status,
// verified_fingerprint}`; a finding whose round could not be ancestry-
// retained for this invocation's --current-head/--repo-root carries
// "not-measured" for both statuses and null for both verified values,
// rather than a fabricated verdict. This is purely additive: no predicate,
// exit code, or verdict depends on it, and it changes no existing check.
//
// Every indeterminate result under --json also carries an additive `code`
// field alongside its existing free-text `reason` (harmon-devkit#1001,
// review round 1) — a stable, machine-readable classification a caller can
// switch on instead of string-matching `reason`. Most indeterminate call
// sites leave it `null` (unchanged from before this field existed); the one
// call site that currently sets a value is `"stage-not-active"` (`--stage
// review` requested while the trusted receipt sequence's active stage is
// still "challenge") — an EXPECTED condition for a run genuinely still in
// progress, not evidence of corruption, which a caller may choose to
// recognize and degrade gracefully rather than treat as a fatal error. This
// changes no exit code, verdict, or existing check.
//
// The --verification-only projection also carries an additive
// `resolved_rounds` object — `{challenge, review, integration, remediation,
// min_rounds}`, the round-caps policy THIS invocation actually resolved and
// used (harmon-devkit#1001, integration cycle 5). A caller that separately
// retained a run's own resolved policy at dispatch time can compare the two
// and fail closed on drift instead of silently trusting whichever caps a
// later .devflow.toml edit happens to resolve today. Purely additive: no
// predicate, exit code, or verdict depends on it.
