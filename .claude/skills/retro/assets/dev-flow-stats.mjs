// The registry's trusted-orchestrator allowlist (issue #741, the field

// trust for run records and evidence comments, evaluated per write against
// the revision of that file in effect at the write's own server-side time
// — never the file's current content, which a later edit could otherwise
// retroactively (re)grant or revoke. specs/dev-flow-v2.md § Evidence and
// the evidence delta spec: authority "derives solely from configured
// trusted-orchestrator actor IDs ... declared in agent-registry.json", and
// "until a repository configures that list, a run record has no authority
// to validate against and its evidence is reported unauthenticated rather
// than silently accepted on an unproven identity."
//
// So this is FAIL-CLOSED, in every direction (maintainer ruling on #741,
// 2026-09-03: an unresolvable governing revision "is indeterminate (fail
// closed)"): no registry revision landed by the write's time, an
// unresolvable revision history, an unreadable file, a revision whose
// allowlist is absent, empty, or malformed — each yields `indeterminate`
// with a reason, and the caller reports the run indeterminate rather than
// falling back to any other source. The --trusted-actor-id /
// --trusted-actors-file set requireTrustedActorIds establishes is the
// OPERATOR'S SELECTION among the registry's trusted orchestrators (which
// of them this harvest is about); it can only ever NARROW the registry's
// set, never widen it, so the registry stays the sole root the specs
// require. (#751 first shipped this mechanism as an additive narrowing
// layer that fell back to CLI-only trust while the field did not exist at
// any commit; that fallback is gone now that the field ships.)
//
// "Revision in effect" is selected by defaultBranchLandedAt(sha) — its own
// merged_at, never a committer/author date (the same spoofable-by-cherry-
// pick field review round 4 of #663 already closed once for post-ready-fix
// detection above) and never firstSeen's broader "visible anywhere"
// signal (shepherd round 2 of #751, Codex-confirmed — see
// defaultBranchLandedAt's own comment) — so a hostile or merely pre-merge-
// visible revision cannot be backdated into looking like it predates the
// write it is meant to govern. Among commits whose landing time is on or
// before atIso, the one with the LATEST landing time wins (the newest
// registry state actually in effect on the default branch by that moment).
//
// The full per-repo revision history (every agent-registry.json-touching
// commit reachable from the default branch, each with its own landed-at
// time) is resolved and cached ONCE per repo, not once per (issue,
// timestamp) pair — shepherd round 4 of #751, Codex-confirmed (P2): a
// --repo scan of R runs against C registry revisions previously re-walked
// the full commit list AND re-issued a commits/{sha}/pulls request per
// revision on EVERY call, roughly 2×R×C synchronous API calls; a moderate
// history could exhaust GitHub's rate limit before ordinary issue
// harvesting even finished. History resolution is now O(C) once; every
// subsequent atIso lookup is an O(C) in-memory scan.
//
// A commit with no merging PR (defaultBranchLandedAt returns null) is only
// possible when the target --repo permits direct pushes to its default
// branch — this repo's own ruleset blocks that (see defaultBranchLandedAt's
// comment), but the CLI is explicitly repository-generic, so a permissive
// target repo cannot be assumed away — shepherd round 4 of #751,
// Codex-confirmed (P1). The unresolvable commit's OWN committer/author
// date is deliberately never used as a fallback: this file's firstSeen
// already established that a pusher-controlled date cannot prove when a
// commit became visible (see firstSeen's own comment) and a cherry-picked
// commit can carry any date its author chooses. Silently SKIPPING the
// unresolvable commit instead (continuing the scan past it) is worse than
// either: a newer revision that happens to be a direct push could be
// silently invisible forever, so the scan would keep selecting a stale,
// resolvable, older revision as if it were current — confidently wrong
// rather than admittedly unknown. So: any unresolvable commit voids the
// WHOLE repo's history (cached as null, same as an API failure), and a
