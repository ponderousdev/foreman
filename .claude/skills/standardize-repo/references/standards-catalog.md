# Standards Catalog

The authoritative list of attributes a repo should have to conform to the
[harmon-init](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init) Copier template
conventions. An auditing or scaffolding agent consults this to answer: **"what
should this repo have, and where does it come from?"**

Ground-truth sources (read these, don't trust memory): `harmon-init/copier.yml`,
`harmon-init/AGENTS.md`, the `harmon-init/template/` tree. Live reference repos
that have been generated from the template: `harmonops/harmon-infra` (an `iac`
project) and `sommerlawn/sommerlawn-site` (a `web-astro` project). This catalog
was refreshed against harmon-init v3.26.1 and harmon-devkit v0.6.2 on 2026-07-13;
**§1.13 (project management) alone was re-verified against harmon-init v4.7.2 on
2026-07-28; its agent-vocabulary target was re-verified against the registry and
ADR on 2026-08-08; and the `claude-*` workflow rows plus their trigger-gate and
claim-lifecycle notes in the Part 1 workflow inventory were re-verified against
the harmon-init v4.26.0 `template/.github/workflows/` tree on 2026-08-10** — the
rest still carries the v3.26.1 baseline, so treat a statement in those
re-verified scopes as current and anything else as possibly lagging. (The v4.7.0
pass recorded the setup scripts as create-if-missing; `e235d43`, released in
v4.7.2, made them append missing starter options to existing single-selects.)
The platform and client repos are kept current via mode-update passes, so their
remaining divergences are often **deliberate customizations** (Part 3.2), not lag
— but they can drift between passes, so
read the repo's actual `_commit` in `.copier-answers.yml` rather than assuming
either way. Treat the **template** as canonical; treat divergences in a live
repo as legit project-type/stack specifics (Part 3), deliberate customizations,
or — in a repo that hasn't been updated recently — template-version lag (3.3).

Every item is tagged:

- **[copier]** — the template generates this automatically; a freshly generated
  repo already has it. An audit flags it only if missing/modified.
- **[manual]** — a follow-up the operator/agent must do by hand (it lives in
  `docs/CHECKLIST.md`, depends on a side-effectful copier answer that defaults to
  `no`, or requires a GitHub/external action copier can't perform).

---

## Part 1 — Universal conventions (every repo)

These apply regardless of `project_type`.

### 1.1 Docs-folder layout

The `docs/` tree is a **routing hub** ("routes; does not hold facts"). Folder
landing pages within `docs/` are `index.md`. **[copier]** generates the whole skeleton.

| Path | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/index.md` | Hub; the four-buckets table | [copier] |
| `docs/conventions.md` | Flat-lookup of enforced rules (grep, don't read) | [copier] |
| `docs/glossary.md` | Term → definition flat lookup | [copier] |
| `docs/CHECKLIST.md` | Run-once post-generation setup list | [copier] |
| `docs/product/` | Why it exists / who for — `vision.md`, `roadmap.md`, `domain.md`, `index.md` | [copier] |
| `docs/architecture/` | How it's built — `index.md`, `ci-cd.md`, `security.md`, `branch-protection.md`, `tests.md` (+ `design-language.md` for web types) | [copier] |
| `docs/decisions/` | ADRs, numbered `0001-`, zero-padded; `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` ships as the template ADR; `index.md` index | [copier] |
| `docs/guides/` | Calm how-tos read in advance — `onboarding.md`, `deploying.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `index.md` | [copier] |
| `docs/runbooks/` | Crisis procedures read under pressure — `index.md` | [copier] |

Repo-root siblings of `docs/` (deliberately NOT under `docs/`):

| Path | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/` | Source of truth for **WHAT to build**; `_template.md` + `README.md`; one spec per feature, Given/When/Then acceptance criteria | [copier] |
| `tests/` | Test files live here; ships with a `.gitkeep` | [copier] |

- **ADR rules:** one ADR per decision; immutable once Accepted; to change a
  decision add a new ADR that supersedes and update the old one's Status
  (Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded). Sections: Status, Context,
  Decision, Consequences.
- **`.gitkeep`** keeps otherwise-empty dirs in git (`tests/.gitkeep`,
  `.claude/skills/.gitkeep`, and ansible `roles|playbooks|inventory/.gitkeep`
  for iac). Across the live repos, `docs/` subdirs are also kept with `.gitkeep`
  (harmon-infra: `architecture/decisions/specs`; sommerlawn-site:
  `decisions/runbooks/specs`).
- **Filling content is [manual]:** most generated docs carry literal `TODO:`
  markers (e.g. `security.md`, `design-language.md`, `DESIGN.md`); the operator
  fills them in. The CHECKLIST item "Fill in the `TODO:` markers" tracks this.

### 1.2 Taskfile (`Taskfile.yml`, go-task v3)

**[copier]** generates `Taskfile.yml`. (`Taskfile.yaml` is equally valid — go-task
accepts both; use whichever extension the tool conventionally uses, don't
normalize.) The Taskfile is the **single
source of truth for commands** — lefthook hooks and CI workflows delegate to
`task` targets so local/CI/hook runs are byte-identical. Never reimplement command
logic in a workflow or a hook.

**Staying in sync (no special repo structure). [copier]** `Taskfile.yml` and the
other template-owned files (`scripts/*`, lint configs, the standard workflows,
devcontainer — full list in
[`assets/template-owned-files.txt`](../assets/template-owned-files.txt)) are
refreshed by `copier update`'s three-way merge, which preserves a repo's own edits.
Customize them **normally, in place** — there is no extension-file convention a
repo's developers need to learn. `assets/diff-template.sh` content-compares the
**entire render** against the repo, not just the curated set: curated entries
report plain `DRIFT`, every other rendered path the repo also has reports the
same `DRIFT` tagged `(uncurated — not in template-owned-files.txt)` — the tag
records that the hand-maintained manifest has not adopted the file, not a lower
severity — and the equally manifest-independent `MISSING` scan catches template
files the repo lacks entirely. Three classes are informational: `OWNED` (the
template's own `copier.yml` `_skip_if_exists` declares the path repo-owned, so
copier will never rewrite it — derived from the rendered commit at run time,
never mirrored; an unreadable, malformed, negated, or templated declaration
exits 2, while a baseline older than the declaration itself keeps running
without the class and says so), `CO-OWNED` (prose the repo owns) and `IGNORED` (untracked, and
ignored by the repo *and the template*); their content never affects the exit
status and their diffs are withheld even under `--show`.
`OWNED` and `IGNORED` are **sweep-only** classes: a path on
[`template-owned-files.txt`](../assets/template-owned-files.txt) always gates,
ignore rules or not, because the manifest is itself an assertion of template
ownership and ignore-based leniency cannot override it — `.claude/settings.json`
is on that list and reports `DRIFT` however thoroughly a repo ignores it.
It compares an unstaged tracked
deletion from the index and reports mature nested Terraform/ADR replacements as
benign `EQUIV`, so an audit/update pulls in missed improvements (the recurring
status.sh / lint-hygiene / bootstrap class) and missed whole files without losing
local customizations — see mode-audit drift class **K**.

Naming & structure conventions:

- **`group:action` (kebab + colon namespacing).** Group/domain first, action
  leaf last: `lint:shell`, `lint:terraform:validate`, `test:e2e`,
  `security:secrets`, `install:hooks`, `status:git`, `deploy:ansible:base`.
  **Never action-first** (`shell:lint`, `yaml:lint`).
- **Pipeline order:** `check → build → validate → test → security`, with
  `verify` (fast local gate) and `ci` (full CI mirror) as aggregates.
  **`verify`** is tuned to stay well under a minute so editors, git hooks, and AI
  agents can run it on every change: `check [→ build] → validate
  [→ test:devcontainer:permissions] → test:tasks [→ test:hooks]`. The devcontainer
  permission assertion is a static, daemon-free configuration check. **`ci`**
  reproduces the whole CI pipeline on demand (run it locally instead of opening a
  PR): `verify → test → security`. The rule: a check only belongs in `verify` if
  it stays fast; genuinely heavy or environment-dependent checks (`test`,
  `security`, container smoke/build tests) live in `ci`. Every `task` target a
  workflow invokes must still exist (drift
  class L) — but `verify` is intentionally a *subset* of what CI runs, so "`verify`
  is green" is not "CI is green"; use `ci` for that.
- **Repo-specific test reachability:** a test is a real local/CI gate only when
  `task install` (the root `Brewfile`) supplies its local runtime, CI
  provisions the same runtime, and the workflow invokes `task test` or that
  specific target. Merely adding it beneath the Taskfile's `test` aggregate is
  not enough when the workflow still calls only `test:tasks`.
- **Hermetic task regression tests:** current `test:tasks` uses temporary fake
  `brew`, `npm`, and `curl` commands; it must not install or update shared
  machine tools. When auditing multiple repos, run older live-tool variants
  serially until the current hermetic script is ported.
- **Parallel deps:** umbrella tasks fan out via `deps:` (which run in parallel),
  e.g. `lint` deps on `lint:yaml`, `lint:shell`, `lint:markdown`,
  `lint:actions`, `lint:hygiene`; `security` deps on `security:sast` +
  `security:secrets` + `security:audit`; `check` deps on `lint` (+
  `lint:typescript` on node repos — the old bare `typecheck` name survives as an
  alias).
- **`{{.CLI_ARGS | default "."}}` passthrough:** lint tasks accept a file list
  (`task lint:yaml -- file.yml`) and default to the whole tree; lefthook passes
  `{staged_files}` through this so hooks lint only staged files.
- **Group output:** `output.group` wraps each task's output in
  `::group::{{.TASK}}` / `::endgroup::` for collapsible CI logs.
- **`default`** task is an interactive `tv`/`fzf` task menu.

Universal task targets every repo has (from the template):

`default`, `menu`, `menu-tv`, `ci`, `verify`, `check`, `lint`, `lint:yaml`,
`lint:shell`, `lint:markdown`, `lint:actions`, `lint:hygiene`,
`lint:commit-msg`, `validate`, `guard:no-commit-to-main`, `format`, `fix`,
`test`, `security`, `security:secrets`, `security:audit`, `security:sast`
(Semgrep CE), `security:sca` (free package-audit alias),
`security:sast:snyk`, `security:sca:snyk`, `secret:set:1p`, `secret:set:gh`,
`bootstrap`, `install`, `install:hooks`, `release:init`, `release:patch`,
`release:minor`, `release:major`, `clean`, `status` (+
`status:git|gh|code|env`), `status:setup`, `util:bunch-add`,
`util:obsidian-add`.

**Lint vs. format discipline (read-only gates).** Every `lint:*` target and the
`check`/`verify` aggregates are **read-only** — they report and fail, never
modify files. All auto-fixing lives in `format`, `format:file`, and `fix` (=
format then lint); **no `lint:*` body runs `--fix`/`--write`/`-w`/`-i`**.
Pre-commit hooks call the read-only `lint:*` so a failing check blocks-and-tells
instead of silently rewriting the tree. **Flag any `lint:*` that mutates** — the
classic regression is `lint:markdown` carrying `markdownlint-cli2 --fix`, which
makes CI report green while discarding the fix and makes the markdown hook commit
the unfixed staged blob (no `stage_fixed`). Formatters (Prettier, Black, shfmt,
`terraform fmt`, markdownlint) have a check side in `lint:*` + a write side in
`format`; pure analyzers (shellcheck, actionlint, yamllint, ESLint, ansible-lint)
are check-only by design.

`status:setup` is a **setup-completeness audit** (run by hand, not part of the
default dashboard): it checks the repo against `docs/CHECKLIST.md` and reports
✓/✗/?/– per item across GitHub config (ruleset, Dependabot alerts, private vuln
reporting, visibility-appropriate SAST route, Renovate and the optional
CodeRabbit app when configured. When CodeRabbit is off, `status:setup` must show
a manual `?` until App access is confirmed removed; account-level installation
metadata cannot prove repository selection. It also checks Actions
secrets/variables by name only, GHCR image, linked Project, release), toolchain
(`brew bundle check`), devcontainer profiles, and dev environment (1Password
CLI, direnv). Useful as a quick first pass when auditing an already-standardized
repo.

Notable command bodies (for an auditor checking they match):

- `lint:shell` → `scripts/shell-quality.sh check`, which passes NUL-delimited
  tracked `*.sh`/`*.bash` paths (or explicit argv paths) intact to
  `shellcheck --severity=error` + `shfmt -d`; `format` calls the same helper
  in write mode
- `lint:markdown` → markdownlint-cli2 `'**/*.md' '#.claude/**' …` — prefers the
  repo-pinned `node_modules/.bin` copy when installed, then a global
  `markdownlint-cli2` from the Brewfile, then a version-pinned npx fallback;
  same pattern in
  `format`/`format:file` for prettier + markdownlint (check-only here; **no
  `--fix`** — auto-fix lives in `format`)
- `lint:hygiene` → `./scripts/lint-hygiene.sh`
- `security:secrets` → `gitleaks detect --no-banner --redact --source .`
- Python `security:audit` → fail-closed `scripts/python-audit.sh`: with a
  `uv.lock`, require it to match `pyproject.toml` while exporting the exact graph
  with `uv export --locked --all-extras --all-groups`; before the first lock,
  compile the project plus `dev` group to a temporary requirements file. Audit
  it with pinned `pip-audit==2.10.1`; no `|| true` or ignored exit status. Any
  CI-only command that consumes an existing lock must use `--locked` (for
  example, `uv sync --locked`) or first run `uv lock --check`; CI must fail on
  staleness and never silently rewrite the lock. Local install/update workflows
  may intentionally create or refresh it.
- `security:sast` → `./scripts/run-semgrep.sh` (Semgrep CE; no account/token)
- `security:sca` → the same free package-manager audit as `security:audit`
- `security:sast:snyk` / `security:sca:snyk` → explicit optional Snyk Code /
  Open Source second-opinion scans; the latter uses `--all-projects`; both accept
  CLI args so the scheduled workflow can pass the repository URL
- `secret:set:1p` / `secret:set:gh` → `./scripts/secret-set-{1p,gh}.sh` —
  destination-only secret writes, value on **stdin** (see §1.8)
- `install` → `brew bundle --file=Brewfile` (+ `uv sync` / `pnpm install`) →
  `install:hooks`
- `install:hooks` → `lefthook install`

### 1.3 File/dir naming, branch & commit conventions

- **Doc filenames are kebab-case** (`branch-protection.md`, `ci-cd.md`). The
  conventional uppercase root files keep their names: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `DESIGN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `LICENSE`, `CHECKLIST.md`. **[copier]**
- **YAML extensions follow each tool's own convention** — no repo-wide
  `.yml`-vs-`.yaml` normalization (go-task → `Taskfile.yml`, yamllint →
  `.yamllint.yml`). Don't rename a tool's file to homogenize extensions.
- **Feature branches only.** Direct commits to `main` are blocked by the
  `guard:no-commit-to-main` pre-commit hook AND the branch ruleset. **[copier]**
  for the hook/ruleset file; **[manual]** to import the ruleset to GitHub.
- **Claude bot branches** are prefixed `claude/` (set in claude workflows and
  parsed by project-automation as `claude/issue-N`).
- **Conventional Commits**, enforced by commitlint (`commit-msg` hook). The
  **type enum** (read from `commitlint.config.mjs`, identical in template and
  both live repos):

  ```text
  build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test
  ```

  Format `type(scope): subject`, imperative mood. Subject/body lines ≤ 100 chars
  (config-conventional). Breaking changes: `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
  **[copier]** ships `commitlint.config.mjs` extending
  `@commitlint/config-conventional`.
- **`TODO:` prefix** (literal, colon) marks unfinished work in code and docs so
  it stays greppable (`rg 'TODO:'`).
- **Never bypass hooks** — `--no-verify` is forbidden (and actively blocked by a
  Claude hook in the devcontainer).

### 1.4 Lint / format configs

All **[copier]** (root-level config files):

| File | Tool | Key settings |
|---|---|---|
| `.editorconfig` | EditorConfig | `root=true`; default 2-space, `lf`, utf-8, final newline, trim trailing ws; **4-space for `*.{py,tf,tfvars,sh}`**; 2-space TOML; Markdown/MDX keep trailing ws (intentional `<br>`); Makefiles tab |
| `.yamllint` | yamllint | `extends: default`; ignores `node_modules/ dist/ .astro/ .task/ .worktrees/ .venv/ .terraform/ pnpm-lock.yaml …`; `line-length max 200` (warn); comments/document-start/truthy disabled |
| `.shellcheckrc` | shellcheck | `disable=SC3037`, `disable=SC2148` |
| `.markdownlint.json` | markdownlint | `default: true`; MD003 atx; MD013 (line-length), MD034, MD036, MD041, MD060 off; blanks-around-headings/lists off |
| `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc` | markdownlint-cli2 | only when `use_release_please`; `ignores: ["CHANGELOG.md"]` (release-please writes double blanks → MD012) |

Shell scripts must pass `shellcheck --severity=error` + `shfmt -d` and stay
portable to **macOS bash 3.2** (no `mapfile`, no `grep -P`) and Linux.

Conditional formatters/linters (see Part 2 for which project types):

- **prettier** — `prettier.config.cjs` (web only): `prettier-config-standard`
  base, `singleQuote`, no semi, `trailingComma:none`, `printWidth:100`,
  `prettier-plugin-astro` + `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`.
- **eslint** — web only (config file is added during framework scaffolding,
  [manual]; template provides the `lint:eslint` task that calls `npx eslint`).
- **black** — Python only (`lint:python` → `uv run black --check`).
- **terraform fmt / validate** — iac/terraform only.
- **ansible-lint** — `.ansible-lint` (ansible only).

**Design-bundle shield (`specs/*/`)** — spec *subdirectories* hold vendored
design handoff bundles (Claude Design exports; deleted at sign-off, never
committed) and are excluded from git and every linter, while top-level
`specs/*.md` stay tracked and linted. Audit that all surfaces agree:
`.gitignore` + `.prettierignore` (`specs/*/`), `.yamllint` ignores
(`specs/*/`), the markdownlint invocation in the Taskfile (`'#specs/*/**'`),
and — web repos, [manual] since those files are scaffolded — eslint `ignores`
(`'specs/'`) and tsconfig `"exclude": ["specs"]`. A repo missing these fails
`verify` the moment a bundle lands (untracked-file hygiene scans included).

### 1.5 Git hooks (lefthook)

**[copier]** ships `lefthook.yml`; installed via `task install:hooks` (`lefthook
install`). `assert_lefthook_installed: true`. Every hook **delegates to a Taskfile
target**.

| Stage | Commands (universal) |
|---|---|
| `pre-commit` (parallel) | `no-commit-to-main` (`task guard:no-commit-to-main`), `yaml`, `shell`, `markdown`, `actions`, `hygiene` — each globbed, passing `{staged_files}` |
| `commit-msg` | `conventional` → `task lint:commit-msg -- {1}` |
| `pre-push` (parallel) | `secrets` → `task security:secrets` |

Project-type stages (added conditionally): pre-commit `prettier`/`eslint`/
`typecheck` (node), `python` (python), `terraform` (terraform); pre-push
`typecheck` (node), `terraform-validate` (terraform), `ansible-syntax` (ansible).

### 1.6 Devcontainer (dual-profile) — when `devcontainer: yes` (default)

**[copier]** generates `.devcontainer/` with **two profiles**:

- **BOT profile** (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) — for AI agents (Claude
  Code, Codex, Gemini). **No Tailscale and no 1Password CLI feature** — the bot
  container must hold no path to the tailnet or a credential store
  (`devcontainer-assert.sh` enforces both structurally, per profile).
  `containerName: devcontainer-<slug>-bot`.
- **DEV profile** (`.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.json`) — human dev. Adds the
  Tailscale feature + `--device=/dev/net/tun` + `TS_AUTHKEY` + the 1Password
  CLI feature.

Shared structure:

- **No `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` in either profile's `containerEnv`** (or
  anywhere else the container exports it) — the env var outranks Claude Code's
  own settings, so pinning it silently overrides the user's saved effort and
  mid-session `/model` changes; effort selection belongs to Claude Code's
  precedence (`/model`, `settings.json` `effortLevel`, model default).
  Applies once the repo's template baseline is a harmon-init release whose
  template no longer renders the pin (first shipped in the release containing
  the removal; every release through v4.24.1 — and any interim release that
  still renders it — shipped the pin in both profiles). On an older baseline,
  treat its presence as a template-version gap the next `copier update`
  resolves, not repo drift to strip by hand: the update preserves a local
  deletion either way, but a hand-strip is a needless customization of
  template-owned content, and taking the removal via the update keeps release
  provenance.
- **`Dockerfile`** — single Dockerfile, base
  `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu-24.04`. Tool version pins are
  **`ARG <NAME>_VERSION=…` annotated with `# renovate: datasource=… depName=…`**
  comments (Renovate's regex manager auto-PRs bumps). `NODE_MAJOR` is
  intentionally unmanaged. Layers ordered cheap→volatile (volatile npm globals
  like `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` LAST so frequent bumps don't bust the
  Chromium/Playwright layers).
- **`devcontainer.json` `features`:** python 3.14, docker-in-docker, github-cli,
  go-task; terraform feature when `include_terraform`; 1password and tailscale
  only in dev.
- **`devcontainer.json` `hostRequirements`:** a minimum floor (`cpus: 2`,
  `memory: 4gb`) on both profiles — a hard gate (Codespaces won't offer a smaller
  machine; VS Code warns; Coder ignores it), not a comfort target. Recommended
  sizing lives in `docs/guides/devcontainer-performance.md`.
- **`config/`** — baked dotfiles (zshrc, shell-aliases, starship, tmux, zellij,
  micro, gitconfig, television, agent-deck) + **`config/claude-settings.json`**
  (installed as Claude Code **managed settings** at
  `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`, highest precedence) +
  **`config/claude-hooks/`** (5 hooks: `protect-files.sh`, `block-no-verify.sh`,
  `enforce-conventional-commits.sh`, `post-edit-format.sh`,
  `session-start-context.sh`, installed to `/etc/claude-code/hooks/`;
  `post-edit-format` + `enforce-conventional-commits` delegate to the `format:file`
  / `lint:commit-msg:text` Taskfile targets).
- **Secret standard — 1Password Environments. [manual]** The values in
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (+ `dev/devcontainer.env`) come from a
  **1Password environment** with destination "Local .env file" mounted at those
  paths — a virtual `.env` over a UNIX pipe, never written to disk or git. Vars:
  `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY` (+ `TS_AUTHKEY`
  dev-only).
- **`scripts/init-env.sh`** — runs as `initializeCommand` on the HOST. It does
  **not** call `op`; it enforces the per-profile allow-list (evicts forbidden
  vars — bot strips `TS_AUTHKEY`; **strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unconditionally**
  since it silently overrides `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) and seeds the env-file
  from the **host environment** — the path used on **Coder/Codespaces**, where
  secrets arrive as workspace/template parameters. Portable to BSD/macOS sed.
- **`post-create.sh` / `post-start.sh`** (+ `dev/` variants) and
  `scripts/post-create-common.sh`; bot sets git identity to `<user>-bot`.
- **`hooks/post-checkout`** — repo-managed git hook (auto-installs node_modules in
  new worktrees).
- **GHCR prebuild:** images push to `ghcr.io/<org>/<slug>-devcontainer[-dev]`
  (`devcontainer_image`) via the `devcontainer-build.yml` workflow as build
  caches. **[manual]** GHCR publishing permission + first prebuild on merge.
- **Coder. [manual]** The devcontainers are Coder-ready (CODER passthrough;
  `config/` baked to `/usr/local/share/devcontainer-config/` to survive Coder's
  `/tmp` shadowing). The Coder workspace *template* is **org-level infra, not
  per-repo** (canonical: harmon-infra `terraform/coder/devcontainer/`): point its
  `repo` + secret parameters at the repo → host env → `init-env.sh`. The
  generated repo's `docs/guides/devcontainers.md` has the full walkthrough.
- **`devcontainer.env`** is gitignored; only `devcontainer.env.example` is
  committed. **[manual]** to populate real secrets.
- **Static permission test:** `test:devcontainer:permissions` calls
  `read-configuration` with `--docker-path /usr/bin/true`, so the fast
  configuration/permission assertion remains Docker-daemon-independent.
- **Smoke tests:** `task test:devcontainer:root` /
  `test:devcontainer:dev` require Docker and GNU `timeout`. They hard-bound
  daemon preflight and cleanup at `-k 5 20`, and the full `devcontainer up`
  lifecycle at `-k 30 1800`, so a wedged daemon or build cannot hang fleet
  verification indefinitely.

### 1.7 CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

**[copier]** generates all workflows. Cross-cutting rules:

- **Delegate to `task` targets** (`task check`, `task security`, `task build`,
  `task test`).
- **Pin third-party actions by full commit SHA** + trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment;
  annotate tool versions with `# renovate: datasource=…`.
- **Least-privilege `permissions:`** per job (top-level `contents: read`).
- **`merge_group`** trigger on `build.yml` (merge-queue support).
- **Aggregate gate:** a final `verify` job (`if: always()`, `needs: [lint,
  security, …]`) reports one rollup status. Branch protection requires
  **`verify`** and **`security`**, plus **`codeql-verify`** exactly when
  `use_codeql=true` and **`terraform-verify`** for a Terraform-capable
  repo (when `include_terraform=true`, the Terraform aggregate is required).
  Result acceptance is predicate-exact, never a generic
  `success || skipped` allowlist. On a fork PR, every fork-suppressed leaf must be
  exactly `skipped`; the diagnostic is workflow-inline, states the untrusted-fork
  boundary explicitly, and neither checks out nor executes repository-controlled
  code. On a same-repository PR or non-PR event, every required leaf must be
  exactly `success`; a conditionally disabled leaf may be `skipped` only when its
  explicit change/enabled predicate proves that exact result. Reject `failure`,
  `cancelled`, `timed_out`, unexpected `skipped`, unexpected `success`, and every
  unknown state. A check that rejects only `failure` is fail-open. The
  `devcontainer-verify` aggregate follows the identical fork-skipped/trusted-
  success contract for its build leaf.
- **Every required context must report unconditionally.** The workflow behind a
  required check triggers on `pull_request` **and** `merge_group`, and no trigger
  filter may keep it from starting on a protected ref — a workflow that does not
  start posts no status, so branch protection wedges that merge exactly like a
  context no workflow defines. Under those two events only three keys are
  allowed, and `verify-applied.sh` rejects anything else unread rather than
  assume it is harmless: `branches:` must cover the protected branch (the
  standard's own `branches: [main]`), `branches-ignore:` must not name it, and a
  `types:` list must keep GitHub's full default set — `opened`, `synchronize`,
  `reopened` for `pull_request` (without `synchronize` a pushed commit never
  re-reports on the new head SHA; without `opened` the check is missing until
  someone pushes) and `checks_requested` for `merge_group`. `paths:` /
  `paths-ignore:` are never allowed on a required check: scope the *work*, not
  the trigger — the workflow always starts and an internal change-detection job
  makes unrelated runs a fast no-op (`terraform.yml`). Path filters remain
  correct on workflows that are **not** required checks (`deploy.yml`,
  `devcontainer-build.yml` where `devcontainer-verify` is not required). Branch
  patterns follow GitHub's glob rules, not the shell's — `*` stops at `/` and
  only `**` crosses it — and are evaluated in order, so a later pattern overrides
  an earlier one. **[audit requirements]** two residuals are deliberately not
  statically decided. Wildcard ruleset ref selectors (`refs/heads/releases/**`)
  name a branch *set*: rulesets match them with `File.fnmatch`, whose globstar
  reading differs from the Actions dialect, so the verifier warns and defers —
  a wildcard `include` gets no branch-coverage check, and a wildcard `exclude`
  is left unapplied so the branches it might remove stay audited. And an
  event-dependent job-level
  `if:` on the reporting job fails the other way — a skipped job still posts a
  status, and GitHub counts a skipped required check as **successful**, so the
  gate is bypassed rather than wedged. That is the fail-open case the
  `if: always()` + result-gating requirement above exists to catch; review any
  reporting job whose `if:` is not `always()`.
- Fork-PR guard: jobs gate on
  `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`.
- **Runner trust boundary [manual residual / audit requirement]:** public
  `pull_request` jobs must stay GitHub-hosted; never let `CI_RUNS_ON` redirect
  them to persistent self-hosted runners.
  Self-hosted execution is limited to private/trusted repositories or trusted
  `push`/`workflow_dispatch` events, with server-side repository-scoped runner
  groups **and** clean ephemeral/JIT isolation. Keep same-repository guards on
  configurable-runner jobs as defense in depth, but a job guard alone is not a
  complete trust boundary. The current template's configurable-runner pattern
  does not mechanically enforce hosted-only public PRs: audit repository
  visibility, events, and `CI_RUNS_ON`, then specialize `runs-on` where needed.
  See [GitHub's self-hosted runner hardening
  guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/security/secure-use#hardening-for-self-hosted-runners).
- **Self-hosted-safe temporary artifacts:** never use a shared fixed `/tmp`
  path for sensitive or cross-step state such as a saved Terraform plan. Create
  a private per-repo/run path beneath `${{ runner.temp }}` (include run
  id/attempt), pass that exact path between steps, and clean it up.

Workflow inventory:

| Workflow | Triggers / role | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `build.yml` (`Build & Validate`) | push/PR/`merge_group`/dispatch; jobs `lint`, `security` (+ `build-test` node, `lighthouse` web-astro); Semgrep runs for free private repos or profiles without CodeQL; aggregate `verify` | [copier] |
| `claude-plan.yml` | Mention-only, no label trigger: an authorized sender's comment or review body carrying the bot mention and then the `plan` subcommand → claims the target, posts a plan, no writes (`--disallowedTools Edit Write Bash`, `--model opus`) | [copier] |
| `claude-implement.yml` | Mention-only, no label trigger: same gate with the `implement` subcommand → claims the target, opens a **draft** PR on a `claude/` branch (`--model opus`, `gh pr ready` denied) | [copier] |
| `claude-review.yml` | Mention-only, no label trigger: same gate with the `review` subcommand, PR targets only, senders extended with the review bots (renovate/dependabot, coderabbit when enabled) → claims the target, posts a sticky review comment, no writes | [copier] |
| `release.yml` | release-please; only when `use_release_please` | [copier] |
| `codeql.yml` | only when `use_codeql=true`; triggers on PR and `merge_group` so required `codeql-verify` reports; matrix is exactly `codeql_languages`; automatic/free for public repos; private/internal requires GitHub Code Security + `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN=true` | [copier] |
| `snyk-scheduled.yml` | only when `snyk_scan_schedule` is `weekly` or `daily`; schedule/manual advisory SAST + SCA, no PR/push trigger or required check | [copier] |
| `devcontainer-build.yml` | only when `devcontainer`; builds bot+dev images, pushes GHCR caches on merge to main | [copier] |
| `project-automation.yml` | only when `github_org != author_git_provider_username` (org repos); syncs org Project V2 Status field | [copier] |

**Mention-only trigger gate** (all three `claude-*` workflows, since
harmon-init#664 / v4.25). They subscribe to `issue_comment` (created),
`pull_request_review_comment` (created), and `pull_request_review` (submitted)
— every issue comment, PR review comment, and PR review in the repo, and
nothing else: `commit_comment` and `discussion_comment` are **not** subscribed,
so a mention on a commit or in a Discussion starts no run at all — and filter in
the job `if:`: the sender
must be on that workflow's authorized-sender set, and the body
must contain that workflow's trigger phrase, which is the `@claude` mention
followed by the workflow's own subcommand word. The sender set is the explicit
`claude_authorized_members` allowlist for plan and implement; review extends it
with the bots whose PRs it runs on (Renovate, Dependabot, and CodeRabbit when
`use_coderabbit`), which is also what it passes as `allowed_bots`. A token-free
`Verify sender is authorized` step re-asserts that same set before any
App token is minted, so a spoof-shaped gap in the `if:` expression cannot reach
credential creation. The old per-workflow label triggers (one label
named after each workflow) and the `issues: [opened, assigned]` trigger were
**removed**. Not because those events lack an actor — `github.event.sender` is
populated on them, and the pre-v4.25 workflows did gate on it — but because the
authorization they can carry is weaker: the sender is whoever labelled or
assigned, not whoever asked for the work; the event carries no comment body, so
the phrase gate collapses to the marker itself; and a label is reachable by any
automation or triager with write access, which makes it a standing trigger
rather than a deliberate request. A repo still
carrying them is template-version lag; report it as such.

**Never write a trigger phrase out in full** — not in this catalog, a repo's
docs, an issue, or a PR comment. The gate is a bare `contains()` on the comment
body, so quoting the phrase anywhere a workflow can read it starts a real run
(observed live on harmon-init#718). Describe it as a mention plus a separate
subcommand token, and keep the two apart even across a line break — rendered
markdown joins wrapped lines back into one string.

**Claim lifecycle** (all three, identical). A **job-level** `concurrency` group
`claude-claim-<issue-or-PR-number>` — deliberately the same name in all three,
so a plan and an implement run on one target serialize over their shared
`claim:claude` label — with `cancel-in-progress: false`. It is job-level, not
workflow-level, because these workflows fire on every comment event and filter
in the job, so a workflow-level group would let skipped runs displace queued
ones. Serialization is not queueing, though: GitHub keeps only **one pending
run per group**, so while one run is active a third mention on the same target
cancels the second one's queued run. Report a vanished command as that limit
rather than as a completed claim lifecycle. The group serializes **Actions runs
only**: an interactive `/claim` session never joins it, and a same-family
session reuses the existing `claim:claude` marker rather than adding its own, so
an Action finishing mid-session deletes the marker the session is still working
under and the target reads as unclaimed. That cross-harness residual is accepted
upstream, not solved here — a claim is a signal, not a lock. Then a
`Claim the target with claim:claude` step paginates the target's
labels and refuses loudly (`::error::` + exit 1) when any `claim:`/`agent:`-
prefixed label is present, when the label list is unreadable, or when
`claim:claude` will not apply — all before the App token is minted, so a
refused run mints no privileged token, spends nothing on the model, and leaves
no claim on the target. It is not free: the runner was already provisioned and
the gate and claim steps ran, so repeated collisions or a stranded claim still
burn Actions minutes or self-hosted capacity. It creates the
label (colour `006B75`, description `Claimed by Claude`, verbatim from
`agent-registry.json`) when the repo lacks it — repo-level label provisioning
is the one write that can survive a refusal, since creation precedes the apply
that may then fail. The prefix test is deliberate: it also catches `claim:claude:opus`,
`claim:gpt`, and legacy `agent:*`, while `suggest:*` is never matched — that is
advice, not ownership. An event with no issue or PR number runs unclaimed.
Release is an `if: always()` step gated on this run having acquired the claim;
it deletes the label, treats a 404 as success, retries once, and otherwise
turns the job red rather than reporting a release over a surviving marker. The
model step also carries its own `timeout-minutes`, set 30 minutes below the job
cap so that an ordinary run hits the **step** timeout — which fails one step and
lets the release run — rather than the **job** cap, which kills the runner with
the `always()` step never reached. That headroom is a margin, not a guarantee:
a preamble (sender gate, claim, token mint, checkout, setup) that eats more than
30 minutes, a lost runner, or a force-cancel all reach the job cap first and
strand `claim:claude` on the target, where it makes later runs refuse. Treat a
target stuck under a claim with no live run as that residual — the marker is
searchable, and removing it by hand is the recovery.

**GitHub App auth** (the claude-* workflows, `release.yml`, and
`project-automation.yml`): authenticate as a **`<owner>-ci` GitHub App** (one App
per org/account), not a PAT. Each job mints a short-lived (~1h) token via
`actions/create-github-app-token` reading **`CI_APP_CLIENT_ID`** (Actions **variable**) +
**`CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`** (Actions **secret**), with **least-privilege
`permission-*` inputs** (e.g. plan: `permission-contents: read` +
`permission-issues|pull-requests: write`; implement adds
`permission-workflows: write`; org repos add `permission-organization-projects:
write`, `permission-members: read`). Requesting a permission the installation
lacks fails token minting — that's why org-only perms are jinja-gated.
`.github/github-app-manifest.json` is the machine-readable permission reference.
**[manual]:** create the App, install it on the repo, set the variable + secret.

Required secrets/variables (**[manual]**, in CHECKLIST): `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
(secret), `CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` (variable) + `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (secret).
`FULL_SECURITY_SCAN=true` is optional and only means a private/internal owner has
enabled paid GitHub Code Security. `SNYK_TOKEN` remains local when
`snyk_scan_schedule=off`; it becomes an Actions secret only when the optional
scheduled workflow is generated (or a paid Snyk CI posture is deliberately
adopted).

### 1.8 Security

The repository-class policy is:

| Repository class | Standard |
|---|---|
| Public, CodeQL-supported | CodeQL + Dependabot alerts/Renovate + gitleaks; no Snyk by default |
| Selected important public | Optionally add Snyk Free as a scheduled SAST/SCA second opinion |
| Private | Semgrep CE is the dependable free CI SAST baseline; keep Snyk Free manual/local by default because Organization-wide quotas can stop scans mid-month |
| Important private | Consider paid GitHub Code Security/private CodeQL and/or paid Snyk, then decide whether per-PR scans should be merge-gating |
| Qualifying public OSS | Consider Snyk's [unlimited open-source program](https://snyk.io/open-source/) |

- **gitleaks** — `.gitleaks.toml` (`[extend] useDefault = true` + an
  `[allowlist] paths` of build/cache dirs). Runs at pre-push (`task
  security:secrets`) and in the `build.yml` `security` job (with the
  `summarize-gitleaks.mjs` GH step summary). **[copier]**
- **Semgrep CE** — `task security:sast` via `scripts/run-semgrep.sh`; part of the
  free local `task security` baseline. `build.yml` uses it for free private
  repositories and profiles without generated CodeQL. **[copier]**
- **Dependabot alerts + package audit** — Dependabot supplies continuous advisory
  monitoring for public and private repositories; `task security:audit` /
  `security:sca` runs the package-manager audit. **[manual]** to enable alerts;
  **[copier]** for tasks.
- **CodeQL** — `codeql.yml` is generated only when `use_codeql=true`, with the
  exact persisted `codeql_languages` matrix. It runs automatically on public
  repositories; private/internal repositories run it only with
  GitHub Code Security + `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN=true`, otherwise `build.yml` uses
  Semgrep CE. An unset/empty `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN` normalizes to the free-private
  route. The analyze job/action never uses `continue-on-error`; its stable
  aggregate requires success for public/paid-private analysis and reports a
  successful not-applicable result only for free-private or untrusted-fork
  routes. The fork path does not check out or execute fork-controlled repository
  code on the aggregate runner. `use_node` and `use_python` describe tooling;
  neither proves that its corresponding source language exists, so reconcile the
  persisted matrix with real first-party source. **[copier]**; **[manual]** only
  for the paid private opt-in.
- **A Copier template repo's payload is not its own source — for capability
  gating.** In a repo whose `copier.yml` declares `_subdirectory:`, everything
  under that root is what *generated* repos receive: harmon-init's
  `template/[% if include_terraform %]terraform[% endif %]/main.tf` is a file
  for its children, not Terraform harmon-init lints. So capability detection
  ("does this repo implement Terraform?") skips the payload — counting it would
  switch on a whole contract the template repo rightly does not implement.
  Security coverage does **not** skip it: the payload is authored code the
  template distributes, so the CodeQL matrix check still measures it and a
  missing language is a real scanning gap.
- **Snyk** — optional `security:sast:snyk` (`snyk code test`) +
  `security:sca:snyk` (`snyk test --all-projects`) second opinions. The default
  `snyk_scan_schedule=off` keeps `SNYK_TOKEN` local and Snyk outside required PR
  CI. `weekly`/`daily` generates an advisory schedule/manual-only matrix workflow;
  daily is intended for public or accepted unlimited OSS projects. Public repos
  must be classified with their public Git remote so private tests are not
  debited. Free private repos normally stay manual/local; weekly is a deliberate
  quota-budgeted exception. A daily Snyk Code schedule is about 30 tests/month
  before manual runs, and SCA can consume one test per detected manifest. No Snyk
  GitHub App is required. **[copier]** for tasks/workflow; **[manual]** for the
  token and posture decision.
- **Branch protection ruleset** — `.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect
  Main.json`: blocks deletion/non-ff/creation, requires linear history, PR with 1
  code-owner approval + thread resolution + last-push approval, required status
  checks `verify` + `security` (+ `codeql-verify` exactly when
  `use_codeql=true`), merge methods
  squash/rebase; org repos add a `merge_queue` rule. Scheduled Snyk and Snyk App
  checks are never required by default. **[copier]** ships the file; **[manual]**
  import via the GitHub UI (Settings → Rules → Rulesets → **Import a ruleset**) — not
  a blind `gh api … rulesets` `POST`, which is non-idempotent and can duplicate
  the ruleset. REST supports `merge_queue`; safe automation must discover
  exactly one matching ruleset and `PUT` its id. Edit the existing ruleset in
  the UI to change it later.
- **`SECURITY.md`** lives in **`.github/`** (Private Vulnerability Reporting).
  **[copier]**
- **Renovate, NOT Dependabot** for version updates. CHECKLIST explicitly says
  enable Dependabot *alerts* + Private vulnerability reporting but **do NOT add
  `dependabot.yml`** — Renovate owns updates. **[manual]** repo settings.
- **`CODEOWNERS`** = `* @<code_owner>` — an asked question that defaults to
  `author_git_provider_username` (a bare organization is not a valid CODEOWNERS
  principal; org repos can deliberately choose `org/team`). **[copier]**
  Existing owners are access control: an intentional replacement must be
  user-confirmed and acknowledged to `verify-applied.sh` as the exact
  `--ack-codeowner-change @old=@new` mapping. Old must exist on `main` and be
  dropped, new must be present, and extra/stale mappings fail.
- **Secrets via 1Password** locally (`op run`/`op inject`); CI reads Actions
  secrets. **`.env` is fully gitignored** (`.env`, `**/.env`, `.env.*`) with a
  single committed exception, `!/.env.example` (names/placeholders only; node
  repos ship a stub). **[copier]** gitignore; **[manual]** wiring.
- **Destination-only secret writes** — `task secret:set:1p VAULT=… ITEM=…
  FIELD=… [SECTION=…]` (existing 1Password fields) and `task secret:set:gh
  NAME=… REPO=owner/repo` (GitHub repo secrets), backed by
  `scripts/secret-set-{1p,gh}.sh`: the value is read from **stdin only** — never
  argv, `--body`, exported env vars, or Taskfile vars (history/process-listing
  hygiene). The 1Password helper fully materializes and validates the item JSON
  before `op item edit` can start; it requires one matching `CONCEALED` field
  and rejects `SSH_KEY`/`PASSKEY` categories, `SSHKEY` fields, and structured
  values because a full-item edit can clobber those credentials. Both helpers
  fail without destination metadata (`test-tasks.sh` asserts it), and agents
  still must not write to a password manager without explicit per-write
  confirmation. **[copier]**
- **`op` is a deliberate human-only toolchain exception.** Root `Brewfile` /
  `task install` does not provision 1Password CLI: install and authenticate it
  explicitly on a human host, or use the human DEV devcontainer profile that
  supplies the feature. The BOT profile must continue to omit every credential-
  store path; never satisfy parity by adding `op` there.
- **1Password credential naming (source of truth).** Authoritative convention is
  in the generated repo's `docs/architecture/security.md` ("1Password
  conventions"); when creating a repo's credentials, follow it verbatim:
  - **One vault per org** (the `<org>` vault) — nothing in personal/shared vaults.
  - **API credentials** use 1Password's **API Credential** type, named
    `<Provider> <scope-descriptor>` — e.g. `Cloudflare <slug>-terraform`,
    `Cloudflare R2 <slug>-tfstate` (Terraform state backend), and **`Cloudflare
    <slug>-github-actions`** for a per-site Workers-deploy token
    (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`). One token per site/purpose (least privilege), one
    1Password item per credential.
  - **Account-level identifiers** get their own per-account item — e.g. `Cloudflare
    <org>` holding `Account ID` (drives the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` Actions var).
  - **Field labels match the provider's docs verbatim** (`Account ID`, `API Token`,
    `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, `Default Endpoint`) — don't invent
    generic labels (`key`, `secret`) or re-case them; references must match exactly.
  **[manual]** — a human creates credentials; the agent never fabricates them.

### 1.9 Dependency management (Renovate)

**[copier]** ships `renovate.json` (extends `config:recommended`). **[manual]**
install the Renovate GitHub App on the repo. Conventions:

- **`automerge: false`** globally; **`minimumReleaseAge: 3 days`** on all
  packages (stability gate).
- **Custom (regex) managers** for pins invisible to native managers:
  - Devcontainer **Dockerfile `ARG …_VERSION`** annotated with `# renovate:`.
  - **Workflow tool pins** — both `version:` style and `FOO_VERSION=x.y.z`
    shell-variable style, under `.github/workflows/`.
  - Ansible: annotated container images + `*_version` vars (iac only).
- **Batching (groupName):** GitHub Actions, Docker images, Devcontainer, npm,
  Terraform providers each into one PR.
- **`anthropics/claude-code-action` ejection:** removed from the Actions group
  (`groupName: null`) and `minimumReleaseAge: 0 days` (ships near-daily; grouping
  - the 3-day gate kept the whole batch perpetually pending). Rule ordered AFTER
  the group rules so the override wins.
- npm `overrides` deptype disabled (avoids `EOVERRIDE`).
- `dependencyDashboard: true`; weekly schedule `before 9am on Monday`,
  `timezone: America/Chicago`.

### 1.10 AI steering

- **`AGENTS.md` is the canonical source of truth.** `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` are **symlinks** to it — edit only
  `AGENTS.md`. (`copier.yml` sets `_preserve_symlinks: true`.) Live repos at older
  commits have the symlink flipped the other way (`AGENTS.md -> CLAUDE.md`) — see
  Part 3. **[copier]**
- **`.claude/settings.json`** (repo-level): minimal allow-list —
  `Bash(task:*)`, `Bash(git status:*)`, `Bash(git diff:*)`, `Bash(git log:*)` —
  plus a `permissions.ask` list that forces a prompt on merge commands:
  `gh pr merge` (all variants incl. `--auto`/`--admin`), `git merge`,
  `git push origin main`, and force pushes (harmon-init ≥3.18.0, init #221).
  **[copier]**
- **Agents never merge to main.** AGENTS.md Definition of Done carries the rule
  (harmon-init ≥3.18.0, init #221): no `gh pr merge`/`git merge`/push to `main`
  without the maintainer's explicit per-merge approval, even with green CI and
  a permissive ruleset — open a draft PR, shepherd the unchanged head, promote
  it to ready for human review only after the complete gate passes, and stop.
  During the staged rollout, this lifecycle applies only when the rendered
  target `AGENTS.md` contains that contract; an older target policy remains
  authoritative until a compatible harmon-init release is selected. When
  CodeRabbit is enabled, `.coderabbit.yaml` must also set
  `reviews.auto_review.drafts: true`, or automated review cannot settle before
  the human handoff.
  The settings `ask`
  rules above are the harness backstop (note: `ask` is skipped under
  `bypassPermissions`, e.g. the devcontainer bot profile — the AGENTS.md rule
  is the binding convention there). **[copier]**
- **`.claude/skills/`** — vendored shared agent skills from harmon-devkit via
  **skills-sync**, gated on the **`use_skills_sync`** copier answer. v3.26.1
  defaulted it on universally; current template source defaults it on only for
  `web-astro` and `web-app`. The profile-seeded `universal` and `infra`
  categories are currently empty, so new general/iac repos default off instead
  of managing an empty set; repos updated through v3.26.1 may already record
  `true` and need an explicit review. When enabled, `skill_categories` starts with
  `universal`, adds `frontend` for both web types, `backend` for `web-app`,
  and `infra` when Terraform/Ansible or the iac type applies. The generated
  `use_codex_cloud_review=true` option overrides that ordinary freedom: it
  requires skills sync and the `universal` category because that category ships
  the mandatory current-head `integrate` classifier — except on a skills-source
  repo (harmon-devkit) that already ships that classifier natively as a
  git-tracked, non-symlink executable regular file at
  `ai/skills/universal/integrate/assets/check-codex-cloud-review.sh`, alongside a
  tracked `ai/skills/universal/integrate/SKILL.md` entry point that is itself a
  regular file (index mode `100644`/`100755`; a `120000` symlink fails however
  valid its target) and whose frontmatter
  is valid — a **closed** `---` block (checked statically) whose values are
  resolved by **yq**, already a hard prerequisite of the guarded update:
  `name` must resolve to the string `integrate` and `description` to a non-empty
  string, so quoted scalars, block scalars, comments, the null spellings
  (`null`, `~`), empty quotes, and empty flow forms are all decided by the
  parser rather than by patterns, and unparseable YAML means "not a valid
  skills source". `scripts/verify-skills.sh` stays canonical for layout — with that
  helper's **executable body** carrying the five dispatch `case` arms
  (`reserve)`, `attach)`, `check)`, `show)`, `reap)`) and the exit contract
  `integrate` reads — `emit pending`/`exit 11` and `emit escalate`/`exit 13` —
  which together satisfy the requirement directly and so may keep
  `use_skills_sync=false` (the update guard and G4 audit both waive
  sync/`universal` on exactly those tests, so a `100755` stub, a missing,
  untracked, or frontmatter-less `SKILL.md`, or a no-op helper that merely
  prints the usage forms in comments all fail the waiver — the guard strips
  comment lines before matching). All of it is static — the helper is never
  executed, so this proves the interface is shipped rather than that it works,
  and a file deliberately shaped to match would still pass. Its human setup also disables
  Codex Automatic reviews so the explicit draft-time cycle remains authoritative
  when the PR is promoted to ready for review.
  machinery is `.skills-sync.yaml`, `scripts/sync-skills.sh`, the
  `sync:skills`/`verify:skills`/`verify:skills:offline` tasks, a CI drift check
  (in the `lint` job) and a pre-push offline check. The drift checks skip cleanly
  until the first `task sync:skills`, so a fresh scaffold stays green. **[copier]**
  ships the machinery + an empty `.claude/skills/` (`.gitkeep`); pinning the
  manifest `ref` to a harmon-devkit release and running `task sync:skills` is
  **[manual]**. harmon-devkit is public, so no token is needed. The dest is
  **shared**: the sync manages only the dirs on the provenance `# managed:`
  line — any other `.claude/skills/<name>` is a **local skill** the repo owns
  (coexists freely; never drift, never touched by sync/verify; a name collision
  with an incoming vendored skill fails the sync loudly before any deletion).
  Pin bumps are the manual pair "bump `ref` → `task sync:skills` → commit"
  (Renovate can't do the re-sync half). Source-repo exception: **harmon-devkit
  itself sets `use_skills_sync: false`** — it IS the source of the skills;
  self-vendoring a pinned copy of its own `ai/skills/` would be circular.
  The harmon-devkit **v0.6 series** introduced this managed-set behavior and
  upgrades a legacy provenance stamp on the first sync; v0.6.2 also rejects an
  absolute or `..`-traversing destination before deletion. Repos on older pins
  need an engine update plus one deliberate re-sync, not merely a ref edit.
  **[copier]**
- **Foreman** — milestone/issue-driven agent dispatch, gated on the
  **`use_foreman`** Copier answer. Foreman v2 is a **thin integration**
  (ponderousdev/foreman#12): when enabled the template adds only
  `taskfiles/foreman.yml` — a wrapper whose `FOREMAN` var is
  `uvx --from git+https://github.com/ponderousdev/foreman@v{{.FOREMAN_VERSION}} foreman`,
  with a renovate-annotated `FOREMAN_VERSION` tag pin
  (`datasource=github-tags depName=ponderousdev/foreman`) — and
  `.foreman.toml` (consumer config: `runner`, `required_capabilities`, the
  `[verify]` table, `trusted_actors`). Consumers hold **no Foreman source**:
  no vendored `scripts/foreman/`, no `.claude/agents/foreman-*.md`, no
  architecture doc — source updates arrive as Renovate pin bumps, verified by
  `task foreman:plan` resolving the pinned version. The v3.26 release
  introduced it default-on (and vendored the full source tree);
  current template source now deliberately defaults to `no`. Always pass an
  explicit per-repo answer on update because this is a deliberate operational
  opt-in, not a passive lint config. A repo scaffolded before the v2 flip must sweep
  every retired v1 artifact per foreman's migration guide — port local
  deltas first, then
  `git rm -rf --ignore-unmatch scripts/foreman && git rm -f --ignore-unmatch .claude/agents/foreman-*.md docs/architecture/foreman.md`,
  guarded in CI by `test ! -d scripts/foreman && test ! -e
  docs/architecture/foreman.md && ! ls .claude/agents/foreman-*.md
  >/dev/null 2>&1`. Absence is deliberate when
  `use_foreman: false`. **[copier]**
- Devcontainer ships richer `config/claude-settings.json` as managed settings (see
  1.6). **[copier]**
- **`DESIGN.md`** — AI-facing statement of design intent (the *why*/prose rules);
  web types get a "Visual & UX direction" section. **[copier]** ships it with
  `TODO:` placeholders; **[manual]** to fill in.

### 1.11 Package / tool management

> **Local ↔ devcontainer parity (a hard goal).** Every binary that the repo's
> routine `Taskfile` gates, lefthook hooks, and `scripts/` invoke must be
> installable **locally via the `Brewfile`** — the repo's baseline tooling has
> to run on a bare host, not only inside the devcontainer. Explicit optional
> integrations are exempt: local `*:snyk` use requires a separately installed
> CLI, and the optional scheduled workflow installs its own pinned CLI. When the
> repo ships a devcontainer, the `Brewfile` (host) and the devcontainer
> `Dockerfile` (container) must cover the
> **same toolset** so `task <anything>` behaves identically in both. Concretely:
> if a task/script/hook calls a binary (e.g. `gum`, `tv`/television, `tokei`,
> `jq`, `gitleaks`, `shfmt`), that binary belongs in the `Brewfile` — and, if a
> devcontainer exists, also in the `Dockerfile`. Auditing this is a first-class
> check (see mode-audit drift class **I**).

- **`Brewfile`** — pins the core toolchain (go-task, lefthook, git, gh,
  shellcheck, shfmt, actionlint, yamllint, gitleaks, uv, node, jq, fzf, fd,
  ripgrep, bat, tokei, gum, television; conditionally pnpm/lychee, terraform,
  hadolint). Semgrep CE is pinned by `scripts/run-semgrep.sh` and executed through
  `uvx`, so the same version runs on a host and in CI. `gum` + `television` (the
  `tv` binary) power the universal
  `status`/`status:*` dashboard and the interactive `task` menu (`menu-tv`), so
  they are required for the dashboard and the bare-`task` menu to work on a host.
  `scripts/status.sh` resolves GNU `timeout` on Linux or Homebrew `gtimeout` on
  macOS, falling back to an unbounded command before dependencies are installed.
  Python is universal because hygiene parses TOML and the secret helpers use
  `python3`; it is not limited to projects that opt into the Python stack.
  Installed via `task install`. `Brewfile.lock.json` is gitignored. **[copier]**
- **Python** (when `use_python`): `pyproject.toml` (`requires-python >=3.14`,
  dev group with `black`; ansible adds `ansible-lint`/`ansible-core`),
  **`.python-version`** = `3.14`, `.envrc` (direnv), managed with **uv** (`uv
  sync`). **[copier]**
- **Node** (when `use_node`): managed with **pnpm**; `package.json` must declare
  `"packageManager": "pnpm@…"` and `engines.node`. The template provides the
  Brewfile/Taskfile/devcontainer wiring; **`package.json` itself is created during
  framework scaffolding** ([manual] — see Part 2 / CHECKLIST).

### 1.12 Versioning & releases

- **Conventional commits drive releases.** **release-please** (when
  `use_release_please`, default yes) maintains a rolling release PR;
  **merging that PR** is the intentional act that cuts the tag + GitHub release +
  CHANGELOG entry (`feat`→minor, `fix`→patch; pre-1.0 `feat` bumps minor;
  chore/docs/ci → no release). Files: `release-please-config.json`,
  `.release-please-manifest.json`. **[copier]**
- **A change that alters what the repo emits to consumers must be `fix:`/`feat:`,
  never `chore:`.** This matters most for a *template/library* repo (e.g.
  harmon-init): a `chore:` edit to generated output — `template/**`, `copier.yml`
  `_tasks`, or a shipped file's mode (`chmod +x`) — cuts no release, so downstreams
  pinned to a tagged `_commit` can never `copier update` to it (they'd have to chase
  untagged HEAD via `--vcs-ref=HEAD`, which the update path forbids). Reserve
  `chore:`/`docs:`/`ci:` for changes that do **not** affect what consumers receive.
- **Keep a Changelog** format; `CHANGELOG.md` is release-please-generated (and
  ignored by markdownlint). **[copier]** seeds it.
- `task release:init` seeds the first `v0.1.0`; `task release:patch|minor|major`
  remain a **manual override**. **Releases are never automated on a normal merge
  to main.** **[manual]** to actually cut a release.
- Other root files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`
  (mit/private), `<slug>.code-workspace`, `.vscode/{settings,extensions}.json`,
  the current-head Codex cloud review contract (the `integrate` stage) only when
  `use_codex_cloud_review=true` (requires `use_codex_review=true`,
  `use_skills_sync=true`, and `universal` in `skill_categories` — the sync and
  `universal` requirements waived for a skills-source repo that ships the
  classifier natively, as above and in G4; **[manual]**
  connect the GitHub integration, confirm plan/quota availability, and grant
  explicit connector permission for a private repository, and disable Codex
  Automatic reviews — review **Trigger** knob included; the post-generation
  checklist states the full knob list — so ready promotion does not launch an
  untracked cycle),
  `.coderabbit.yaml` only when `use_coderabbit=true` (CodeRabbit reviews —
  [manual] install the app),
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` YAML **Issue
  Forms** (`{bug,feature,task,research}.yml` and `config.yml`, always generated —
  see §1.13 for the `type:`/assignee behavior), `.dockerignore`. **[copier]**

### 1.13 Project management (GitHub Projects) — when `project_management: github`

The `project_management` copier answer (`github` / `linear` / `none`, default
`none`) gates a GitHub-Projects playbook. **`github`** ships
`docs/project-management.md` — the authoritative doc (statuses, fields, labels,
milestones, hierarchy, cross-repo, views) — plus the setup tasks/scripts below.
**`linear`** ships a `# Linear` TODO stub; **`none`** ships neither. **[copier]**
for the doc/tasks/workflows; **[manual]** to run the setup (they hit the live
GitHub API and are shellcheck/shfmt-gated only, never CI-tested).

The agent vocabulary is not locally invented. Its source contract is
harmon-init's
[`agent-registry.json`](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init/blob/cc5b735b6c512738cf8689df393df8a20d409cee/agent-registry.json),
with the axis and lifecycle decisions recorded in
[ADR 0005](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-init/blob/cc5b735b6c512738cf8689df393df8a20d409cee/docs/decisions/0005-unified-agent-vocabulary.md).
Those links pin the immutable contract revision reviewed for this catalog. When
auditing, compare against the target's selected immutable harmon-init revision.
If that revision lacks the registry, report template-version lag and follow the
applicable mode's existing remote-verified release-selection procedure. Never
infer the target's current roster from these reference links or mutable `main`.

**One default Project (V2) per owner**, titled after the owner's GitHub login
(`<owner> Project`); every repo feeds the one board. Its six planning axes are
**Status, Priority, Size, Product, Domain, and Layer**. Slice it by those
single-valued fields — for `Domain` and `Layer`, use the field rather than the
mirrored `domain:`/`layer:` labels, which carry the same option names but are
never synced to field values. Advisory agent routing is multi-valued label
metadata, not a seventh field. The retired `Agent` field is not part of the
target state; on an older board, review and migrate its values before deleting
it because the setup scripts are deliberately additive-only. Live field removal
belongs to harmon-init's migration units, not this catalog; until those units
verify the owner-wide associations and fleet state, leave the field in place.

**Setup tasks** (idempotent + non-destructive; **[copier]** generates them, **[manual]** to run):

| Task | Needs | Rendered when | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup:github-project` | `gh` + `project` scope | `project_management: github` | Create/sync the board + `Status` pipeline + the `Size` number field (both owner types); write the `ORG_PROJECT_ID` org var (org only); on a **personal** account also create Priority/Product/Agent/Domain/Layer as project fields in pre-rollout releases |
| `setup:github-labels` | `gh` + repo write | `project_management: github` | Create/update the release-defined static label list; pre-rollout releases still include legacy `agent:*` rows and, when `use_foreman` is enabled, phantom `foreman:*` rows rather than the registry-driven target |
| `setup:github-issue-fields` | `gh` + `admin:org` | `github` **and** org owner | Add the org **issue fields** Product + Agent + Domain + Layer in pre-rollout releases (public preview) |
| `setup:github-issue-types` | `gh` + `admin:org` | **org owner** (independent of `project_management`) | Ensure org issue types Bug/Feature/Task/Research (Task is GitHub's default; adds Research) |

Those rows describe executable behavior in pre-rollout harmon-init releases,
not the registry's completed target. The ordered rollout is owned by
harmon-init#661–#665 and the linked devkit session-suite unit, not re-specified
here. Until those changes reach the selected releases, report the difference as
template-version lag and leave live fields and labels unchanged.

**Conventions the doc encodes** (audit the doc + the field/label/workflow
artifacts; the prose rules are guidance, not lint):

- **`Status`** — project single-select, one meaning ("where in delivery"):
  Inbox/Icebox/Next · Todo/Shaping/Ready/Agent Queue · In Progress/Verifying/
  In Review/Ready to Merge · Done/Deployed/Accepted. `Done` is the sole terminal
  status; **no `Archived`** (native 90-day auto-archive); Canceled/Duplicate are
  close reasons; Blocked is the native blocked-by relationship or `blocked` label.
  `Agent Queue` is the AI-agent hand-off lane.
- **Fields** — `Status` is a project field. **Size is ALWAYS a project Number
  field** (estimation points, Fibonacci): only project number fields sum in view
  group headers, so it lives on the project even for orgs. The GitHub built-in
  issue fields (**Priority**, single-select **Effort**, Start/Target date) are
  left at their defaults — **`Effort` is never re-created as a project field**;
  `Size` is the numeric, summable estimate. In the target state, **Product +
  Domain + Layer** are org issue fields from `setup:github-issue-fields` (Domain
  = which part of the product, Layer = which slice of the stack). On a personal
  account (no issue fields), their equivalents plus Priority/Size are project
  fields. Pre-rollout scripts also create the retired `Agent` field. Both scripts
  are **create-if-missing then additive** for every field they declare: an
  existing field keeps every option it has, and a re-run appends whatever
  **starter** option it lacks — `Status` and the custom fields alike, so items
  already assigned an option are never orphaned. Neither script ever **removes**
  an option or a field, so a starter the template retires survives until you
  delete it by hand (only after re-mapping — deleting an assigned option clears
  those values). **[manual]**
  What a re-run still will not do: add **repo-specific** options (the scripts ship
  only the `auth`/`billing`/`platform` floor — this product's real domains are
  yours to add), or fix anything the script *warned and continued* past. Both
  warn-and-exit-0 rather than abort a half-reconciled project — with one known
  upstream gap: `setup-github-project.sh` routes only the **custom** fields
  through its `field_exists` data-type guard, so a reused project carrying a
  non-single-select field named **`Status`** goes straight to `append_options`
  and the task fails there instead of warning (possibly after `ORG_PROJECT_ID`
  was already written). Treat that one as a hard stop, not a warning. Otherwise
  read the WARNING lines: a field that already exists with the **wrong data type**
  (GitHub can't
  change a type in place, and deleting the field destroys every issue's value for
  it org-wide — rename it, let the re-run create the replacement, migrate the
  values, then delete the original), one **at the
  single-select option cap**, or an issue-fields `PATCH` **rejected by the public
  preview**. Each names the field and the options it skipped. Skipping those
  leaves the label and field vocabularies divergent.
  The option arrays are replaced wholesale with no expected-version token, so
  **never run these concurrently against one owner** — a racing write (parallel
  fleet run, or the Project UI) can be silently dropped along with its
  assignments.
- **Issue types** — Bug/Feature/Task/Research (org). The Issue Forms set `type:` on
  org repos and a **default assignee**, and apply **no labels** (type is the Type
  field, not a label).
- **Labels** — repo-level, multi-valued, and orthogonal to Status and Type. The
  base taxonomy includes:
  **Concerns** (purple `5319E7`) `sec`, `a11y`, `perf`, `tech-debt`, `i18n`,
  `l10n`; **Source** (pink `EC4899`) `customer-request`, `ai-generated`;
  **Workflow** (orange `E36209`) `needs-triage`, `needs-requirements`, `blocked`,
  `waiting`, `needs-decision`, `needs-response`, `needs-communication`;
  **Layer** (blue `1D76DB`) `layer:ui`, `layer:logic`, `layer:data`,
  `layer:integration`; **Domain** (yellow `FBCA04`) `domain:auth`,
  `domain:billing`, `domain:platform`. The `layer:`/`domain:` families are
  deliberately the **same vocabulary** as the Layer/Domain fields above — same
  option names, but **nothing syncs a label to a field value**, so group board
  views by the fields and use the labels for `gh issue list --label`; extend the
  label list and both field lists together. Names must agree where they overlap,
  but the sets need not be equal: on an org the `Domain` issue field is org-wide
  while labels are repo-level, so a repo's `domain:` labels are the **subset** it
  actually uses, not the org's full option list. There is no shared
  org label pool; run `setup:github-labels` per repo. It is create-or-update
  (`--force`) and never deletes, so a repo seeded before the layer family became
  `ui`/`logic`/`data`/`integration` keeps orphaned `layer:frontend`,
  `layer:backend`, `layer:infra` labels — re-map those issues and delete the three
  by hand. **[manual]**
- **Model-centric routing and claims** — use
  `suggest:<family>[:<model>]` for human-authored, advisory triage and
  `claim:<family>[:<model>]` for agent-authored live ownership. Both accept a
  family-level label; add the optional model segment only when it is known and
  useful. Interactive session claims are released at wrap or integrate completion;
  Claude Action claims are released by an unconditional `if: always()` cleanup
  step, so an ordinary failure or step timeout still releases. The exception is a
  run that never reaches that step at all — a job-cap kill, a lost runner, or a
  force-cancel — which strands the marker; see the claim lifecycle under Part 1's
  workflow inventory. Treat a claim with no live run as that case, not as
  ownership.
  Transition-compatible consumers also recognize documented legacy `agent:*`
  claims. Neither family arms execution or records historical doneness. Harness
  slugs never belong on either model-centric axis, and the `Agent` field is not a
  planning axis. For a post-rollout target, `docs/project-management.md` is the
  human authority and includes family and harness tables derived from the
  target's selected registry revision, not an independently maintained roster.
- **Foreman arming** — only an authorized actor's `foreman:<adapter>` label arms
  dispatch; `suggest:*` remains advisory even when its family resembles an
  adapter. The registry maps the harness-centric adapter and only adapters in the
  pinned Foreman release are provisionable; test-only `mock` is not. Detailed
  dispatch and input-trust enforcement belong to Foreman and the selected
  target's configuration, not a second procedure in this catalog.
- **`.devflow.toml` — Dev Loop rigor/strategy/tier config.** Root-level TOML
  parameterizing the Dev Loop stages in `AGENTS.md`: `[rigor.*]` round-cap
  levels (`trivial`/`minimal`/`light`/`standard`/`thorough`/`deep`), the
  `[strategy.*]` execution-topology family (`oneshot`/`plan`/`plan-approved`/
  `orchestrate`/`council`/`human-led` — harmon-init#1047 renamed the retired
  `method:*`/`[method]` family to `strategy:*`/`[strategy.*]`), and the
  `[tier.*]` model-routing ladder consumed by unscoped `tier:*` (implementer
  role only) and scoped `tier:orchestrator:*`/`tier:implementer:*`/
  `tier:reviewer:*` labels. **[copier]** — harmon-init keeps its own root copy
  and `template/.devflow.toml` byte-identical, so a freshly generated repo's
  copy is a verbatim copy of the template's; like `Taskfile.yml` it is then
  customizable in place ("Retuning these is expected", per its own header
  comment), so audit its drift the same way. It is deliberately **not** on
  [`template-owned-files.txt`](../assets/template-owned-files.txt) — a repo's
  resolved caps are expected to diverge from the template's, same reasoning as
  `label-registry.json`/`agent-registry.json` — so `diff-template.sh` (§3 drift
  class K, [`mode-audit.md`](./mode-audit.md)) still catches its drift, tagged
  `(uncurated)` rather than plain `DRIFT`. The `rigor:*`/`strategy:*`
  **labels** are a separate axis from the file: provisioned by
  `task setup:github-labels` from `label-registry.json` (above), gated on
  `project_management: github` like the other setup tasks. A repo updating
  through the harmon-init release that ships the `method:*`→`strategy:*`
  rename needs the **live-label migration recipe** in
  [`mode-update.md`](./mode-update.md) §6b, run **before** that section's
  `task setup:github-labels` line — `setup-github-labels.sh` only ever adds,
  and GitHub label names are unique, so a repo's old live `method:*` labels
  (and their issue associations) survive the file update untouched, and a
  rename attempted after that line already created `strategy:*` is rejected
  as a name collision.
- **Milestones** — named after release versions (title == git tag), small +
  rolling, preferred over iterations pre-launch.
  `.github/workflows/close-milestone-on-release.yml` closes the matching milestone
  on release publish — **[copier]** when `use_release_please` + `github`.
- **Views** (Board / Triage / Agent queue / Planning / Mine) are **UI-only** —
  Projects V2 has no view API. The Agent queue view keys on `Status: Agent Queue`
  and may filter by `suggest:*`; it never depends on an `Agent` field. **[manual]**.
- **Auto-add** — the project's built-in **"Auto-add to project"** workflow
  (Settings → Workflows, filter `is:open`) puts every issue/PR on the board, for
  both owner types. UI-only, no API. **[manual]**. Three limits bound the "every
  repo feeds the one board" rule: a workflow targets **one repo** (so each repo
  needs its own), it **never backfills** existing items (only ones created or
  updated after it is on), and a project may hold only **1 on Free, 5 on
  Pro/Team, 20 on Enterprise** — past the cap the rule does not hold and no
  fallback is specified: an `actions/add-to-project` workflow needs a
  Projects-write token (not `GITHUB_TOKEN`), and fork-PR coverage needs a
  fork-influenced trigger the CI App key must never be read from, so closing the
  gap is an open design question. Filter qualifiers AND together, so
  `is:issue is:pr` matches nothing; leave the type unqualified.
- **Hierarchy** — sub-issues, no Epic type: the parent holds the spec +
  milestone/project (children inherit both); leaves hold the `Task` type + the
  **`Size` points** (the numeric estimate — on an org, the built-in `Effort`
  single-select is a separate coarse field left at its default and never used for
  points; on a personal account there is no `Effort` field at all).

**Org-only automation** (`github_org != author`):
`.github/workflows/project-automation.yml` syncs `Status` from PR/CI events as the
CI GitHub App, reading the `ORG_PROJECT_ID` org variable (title fallback).
**[copier]**. It only updates items already on the board, so it depends on the
**Auto-add** workflow above being on for the repo.

### 1.14 Issue & PR tracking hygiene

Independent of `project_management` — these apply to any repo with an issue
tracker. Enforced by the vendored **`track-work`** skill at authoring time and,
where the repo ships it, by a **tracking guard** at PR time
(`.github/workflows/tracking-guard.yml` → `task guard:closing-keywords` →
`.claude/skills/track-work/assets/check-closing-keywords.sh`). The check lives
inside the skill so it is vendored with it; a repo that syncs the `universal`
category has it and only needs the task + workflow wired up. **[manual]** — the
template does not yet render either, so audit for the skill, not the workflow.

- **`Refs #N` is the default in a PR body**; a closing keyword (`Closes`/`Fixes`/
  `Resolves`) only when the PR resolves the issue entirely. An issue with
  unticked items must not be auto-closed — tick what the PR satisfies or use
  `Refs`. Never close across repos. **On a squash-merge repo the PR title is the
  same vector** (it becomes the commit subject), so the guard checks both.
  **Keep the bare `#N` out of the commit message when the work is partial**:
  where a changelog is generated from commits, a reference in the commit footer
  is re-rendered under a `closes` list whatever keyword introduced it, and
  `Refs` stops protecting anything. The PR body is not read by the generator,
  so a reference kept there does the linking without the risk.
- **A bare `#123` means the current repo.** Cross-repo references are written
  `owner/repo#123` (or a full URL) everywhere, including when verifying them.
- **Re-read an issue before describing it**, including one read earlier in the
  same session.
- **Follow-up work is filed in the repo that owns the code, immediately**, with a
  provenance line — never batched into a tracking issue or a follow-ups doc.
- **Search the target repo before filing there** — `gh issue list --repo <target>
  --state all --limit 200 --search "<phrase>"`. The bullet above moves the target
  away from the tracker you have open, which is how a cross-repo follow-up
  duplicates silently.
- **Close reasons are factual**: `completed` means built; declined / obsolete /
  superseded are `not planned` with a comment naming the replacement; `duplicate`
  is its own reason and must name the canonical issue, since GitHub stores the
  reason and not the target.
- **Perishable claims carry a `## Verify` command** (`Invariant` / `Current
  violation (observed YYYY-MM-DD)` / `Verify`). Strongest form where a test
  harness exists: a failing assertion instead of a description.
- **Acceptance criteria are `- [ ]` task-list items** — the closing-keyword guard
  reads them, so an issue without them silently loses the protection. **Every**
  Issue Form seeds a task-list field and a `Verify` field, bug reports included:
  a form that omits the checklist leaves that whole issue type unprotected. A
  `checkboxes` field satisfies this too — it renders as `- [ ]` in the body.

---

## Part 2 — By project type

Driven by the `project_type` copier answer: `general` / `web-astro` / `web-app` /
`iac` / `docs`. Two derived flags gate most behavior: `use_node` (true for
`web-astro`, `web-app`) and `use_python` (true for `iac` or when
`include_ansible`). `include_terraform` / `include_ansible` default to true for
`iac`.

**Repo naming (`<base>-<suffix>`).** Name a repo by what it contains:
`-site` (websites / marketing / static sites — typically `web-astro`), `-app`
(web/product applications — `web-app`), `-infra` (IaC — `iac`), `-docs`
(documentation sites — `docs`), `-mobile` (mobile apps), `-hub`
(umbrella / landing repos). Use **`-site`, never the older `-web`**: "web" is
overloaded (every app is on the web) and collides with the natural name for a
web client, whereas `-site` lines up cleanly with the other suffixes. So
`sommerlawn-site` / `ponderous-site`, not `*-web`.

**Important:** harmon-init is a **conventions-only** template — for web/app types
it scaffolds the tooling/config but **not the framework itself**. Installing the
actual framework + stack is a [manual] CHECKLIST step.

### 2.1 general

The baseline. Only Part 1 universals apply. `use_node`/`use_python` both false
unless ansible/terraform opted in.

- `test` task is a `TODO:` echo pointing to `tests/` + `docs/architecture/tests.md`. [copier]
- `validate` task echoes "No validate steps for this project type yet — see docs/CHECKLIST.md." [copier]
- `security:audit` echoes "No package manifests to audit yet." [copier]
- **[manual]:** add the primary toolchain; extend `build`/`test` accordingly.

### 2.2 web-astro (marketing/static sites) — `use_node: true`

Adds (all [copier] unless noted):

- **Taskfile:** `build` (`pnpm build`), `build:preview`, `dev`,
  `lint:typescript` (`astro check`; `typecheck` alias kept), `lint:prettier`,
  `lint:eslint`, `test` (vitest if config present),
  `test:e2e[:screenshot|:pdf]` (Playwright); `verify`/`ci` include `build`.
  `test:e2e` loads `.env.local` and runs **`scripts/e2e-env-guard.sh` first** —
  a fail-closed guard against production-capable credentials/targets in the e2e
  environment that **fails until configured** with the app's providers and prod
  domains ([manual] at scaffold time; omator's guard is the reference).
- **prettier.config.cjs**, eslint task. **lefthook** adds prettier/eslint/
  typecheck (pre-commit) + typecheck (pre-push).
- **`lighthouserc.json`** + a **`lighthouse`** CI job in `build.yml` (Chrome
  install, LHCI, PR comment). Asserts perf ≥0.7 (warn), a11y ≥0.85, BP ≥0.7, SEO
  ≥0.9.
- **`docs/architecture/design-language.md`** + DESIGN.md "Visual & UX direction".
- Devcontainer forwards port **4321** (Astro dev server); `astro-build.astro-vscode` extension.
- With first-party JS/TS source, `use_codeql=true`, and live Code Security
  capability, `codeql.yml` analyzes `javascript-typescript`; otherwise the
  workflow is intentionally absent and the SAST gap is documented. Do not count
  an ESLint/Prettier/Astro config file by itself as application source.
- **[manual] CHECKLIST:** `pnpm create astro@latest .`; add **Tailwind v4**
  (`@tailwindcss/vite`), **zod**, **vitest**, **lucide**; move lint tooling into
  `devDependencies` (the Taskfile auto-prefers repo-pinned `node_modules` bins
  over `npx --yes` once installed); review `lighthouserc.json` URLs; enable
  **mobile device projects** in `playwright.config.ts` (e.g. Pixel + iPhone —
  the scaffold ships them commented out, and mobile-first is the stated
  convention).

### 2.3 web-app (TanStack/React apps) — `use_node: true`

Same node tooling as web-astro **except**:

- `lint:typescript` uses `tsc --noEmit` (not `astro check`) — and when the root
  `tsconfig.json` is **solution-style** (`files: []` + `references`) it
  auto-detects that and runs **`tsc -b`** instead (a plain `--noEmit` against a
  solution file type-checks nothing and reports green). [copier]
- **Shipped `eslint.config.js` is ESLint 10 with type-aware linting on by
  default**: `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` + `projectService`
  (catches floating/misused promises against async backend APIs like Convex
  `ctx`); **no `eslint-plugin-react`** (not v10-ready; ESLint 10 tracks JSX
  natively) — react-hooks, `@tanstack/eslint-plugin-router`, and
  `@convex-dev/eslint-plugin` plugins; `eslint-config-prettier` last; typed
  rules disabled for plain `js/cjs/mjs` config files. Generated files are
  committed but never linted/formatted: `src/routeTree.gen.ts` +
  `convex/_generated/` sit in the ESLint `ignores` and `.prettierignore`.
  Under `projectService` **every linted TS file must belong to a tsconfig
  project** — `convex/` carries its own runtime-accurate `convex/tsconfig.json`
  (`"types": []`, excludes `./_generated`). [copier]
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `sharp: false` (web-astro keeps `true` for Astro's
  image pipeline); `workerd: true` only when deploying to Cloudflare Workers.
  pnpm 11's default `minimumReleaseAge` (1 day) is documented in the file —
  version-pinned `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries unblock a freshly published
  pin and age into no-ops. [copier]
- `prettier.config.cjs` ships `tailwindStylesheet` **commented** (Tailwind v4
  has no config file for the plugin to discover; the plugin hard-fails on a
  missing path) — uncomment once the app's main stylesheet exists. [copier] +
  [manual] activation.
- **No** Lighthouse job / `lighthouserc.json` (that's web-astro only). [copier]
- DESIGN.md / design-language reference **shadcn/ui** as the component set. [copier]
- **[manual] CHECKLIST:** `pnpm create @tanstack/start@latest` (TanStack Start)
  or vite + react; add **Tailwind v4**, **shadcn/ui**, **zod**, **vitest**,
  **lucide**; move lint tooling to `devDependencies` (Taskfile auto-prefers the
  pinned bins); install the ESLint 10 plugin set; configure
  `scripts/e2e-env-guard.sh` before the first e2e run; document env vars in
  `.env.example`; split `vitest.config.ts` into **projects** when the backend
  needs a different runtime (e.g. `react`/jsdom + `convex`/edge-runtime with
  `convex-test`).

### 2.4 iac (Terraform/Ansible) — `use_python: true`

Adds (all [copier]):

- **`include_terraform`** → `terraform/` skeleton (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`,
  `outputs.tf`, `tfvars.env.example`). `lint:terraform`, reached transitively by
  `check`, aggregates `lint:terraform:fmt` (`terraform fmt -check -recursive`),
  `lint:terraform:tflint`, `lint:terraform:security` (Renovate-pinned Checkov via
  `uvx --from "checkov==…"`), and `lint:terraform:locks`.
  `lint:terraform:validate` remains the separate validation path. The root
  `Brewfile` supplies Terraform, TFLint, and uv locally; in CI, the **job that
  runs `task check`** provisions Terraform, pinned TFLint, and uv — through its
  own steps (a split repo's `validate.yml` lint job) or through the local
  composite action that job invokes (`./.github/actions/setup`). The binding is
  per job, not per workflow or per repo: a setup action in a sibling job, an
  unused composite, or a dead workflow installs nothing on the gate job's runner.
  A docs claim or a defined-but-unreachable leaf task is not lint coverage.
  Lefthook runs the lint aggregate pre-commit and validate pre-push; the
  devcontainer includes Terraform; Renovate groups Terraform providers; VS Code
  includes hashicorp/terraform.
- **Terraform CI invariants:** commit `.terraform.lock.hcl` after the explicit
  first provider-bearing initialization. `task terraform:providers:lock` calls
  `scripts/terraform-provider-locks.sh update terraform`; the lint aggregate calls
  the same helper in `check` mode. The helper generates and compares checksums for
  exactly `darwin_arm64` (developer) and `linux_amd64` (GitHub CI) in a scratch
  copy, leaving the checkout untouched in check mode. Scratch initialization
  passes `-upgrade` only in update mode, so an intentional provider constraint
  bump can move beyond the selection in the committed lock; check mode must omit
  `-upgrade`. A fresh scaffold with no provider requirements cleanly skips lock
  creation. The hermetic
  `scripts/test-terraform-provider-locks.sh` regression must remain reachable
  through the task tests. A lock file's mere presence does **not** prove platform
  coverage; require this authoritative update/check process.

  Once a lock is tracked, CI uses
  `terraform init -lockfile=readonly`; only an explicit fresh-scaffold/local
  initialization may create the initial lock, and an intentional local provider
  update may refresh it; ordinary CI must not. The workflow listens to `push`,
  `pull_request`, `merge_group`, and `workflow_dispatch` with no top-level
  `paths` filter. Its internal change detector makes unrelated paths a no-op,
  while the required GitHub-hosted `terraform-verify` aggregate runs under
  `if: always()` and accepts `skipped` only when the explicit fork/change/enabled
  predicates prove that result deliberate.

  Credentialed plan/apply is downstream of successful validation and guarded by
  the change result, an explicit enable flag, same-repository trust, and a
  trusted-main push/dispatch apply condition. Repository/ref concurrency plus a
  repository/run/attempt artifact key namespaces each run. Save the binary plan
  under a private run-scoped directory, display that exact artifact, and apply
  it without re-planning; use bounded state-lock waits (`-lock-timeout`), never
  `-lock=false`, and clean up under `if: always()`. Agents never run
  `terraform apply`, `destroy`, `import`, or state-mutating commands without
  explicit approval for that exact operation. The reviewed trusted-main CI apply
  of its own saved plan is the defined automation exception.
- **`include_ansible`** → `ansible/` skeleton (`ansible.cfg`, `requirements.yaml`,
  `inventory/ playbooks/ roles/` each `.gitkeep`); **`.ansible-lint`**; tasks
  `lint:ansible`, `validate:ansible:syntax` (both guard on `ansible/site.yml`
  existing); lefthook ansible-syntax (pre-push); `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` remoteEnv;
  Renovate ansible regex managers; redhat.ansible extension.
- **Python toolchain** active (uv, black, `.python-version`, pyproject).
- Do not infer Python CodeQL coverage from the iac type. An infrastructure repo
  may have no first-party `.py` files. Select `use_codeql` deliberately and
  reconcile `codeql_languages` with actual source (including another supported
  language such as `javascript-typescript` when present) plus live Code Security
  capability.
- **[manual] CHECKLIST:** lay out `terraform/` and/or `ansible/site.yml` — lint
  tasks activate automatically once `ansible/site.yml` exists.
- The live `harmon-infra` shows how deep the namespacing legitimately goes:
  `lint:terraform:{docs,tflint,validate,security}`,
  `validate:templates:*`, `deploy:ansible:{base,docker,services,…}`,
  `terraform:{init,plan,apply,output}` — all still `group:action` kebab.

### 2.5 docs (documentation/Obsidian) — neither node nor python

Like `general` (no `build`/framework). [copier]

- **[manual] CHECKLIST:** decide the docs toolchain (plain markdown / Obsidian
  vault / static site generator).
- `obsidian_project_add` (default no) wires `util:obsidian-add` + a vault note.

---

## Part 3 — Known divergences (do NOT flag these)

Legitimately repo- or type-specific differences. An auditor should treat these as
**expected**, not drift.

### 3.1 Conditional-by-design (driven by copier answers)

- **No `terraform/` or `ansible/`** in non-iac repos (gated by
  `include_terraform`/`include_ansible`).
- **No node tooling** (`prettier.config.cjs`, `build`/`dev` tasks, eslint/
  typecheck hooks, `lighthouse` job) in non-web repos.
- **No `pyproject.toml`/`.python-version`/`.envrc`/black** when `use_python` is
  false (general/web/docs without ansible).
- **No `lighthouserc.json` / lighthouse job** outside `web-astro`.
- **No `.devcontainer/`** when `devcontainer: no` (e.g. harmon-infra was
  generated with `devcontainer: false`, so it lacks the dual-profile setup — it
  later added its own `.devcontainer/`).
- **No `release.yml` / release-please manifest** when `use_release_please: no`
  (then releases are purely `task release:*`).
- **No `codeql.yml`** when `use_codeql=false`. When enabled, the workflow matrix
  is exactly the persisted `codeql_languages`; audit that selection against real
  first-party source rather than treating tooling flags as coverage. A
  private/internal repository should select CodeQL only when GitHub Code Security
  is enabled; otherwise it uses Semgrep CE and documents the deliberate omission.
- **No `project-automation.yml`, no org `merge_queue` rule, no
  `permission-organization-projects`/`permission-members`** for personal-account
  repos (`github_org == author_git_provider_username`). Org repos get all three.
- **`design-language.md` / DESIGN.md web section** only for web types; shadcn/ui
  named only for `web-app`.
- **macOS-only meta** (`util:bunch-add`/`util:obsidian-add`, `.meta/`, Bunch
  cask) gated by `bunch_add`/`obsidian_project_add` (default no).

### 3.2 Tech-stack preferences (web), expected to vary by repo

These are **defaults/recommendations**, not hard requirements — a conforming repo
picks from this palette:

- **Astro** (web-astro), **TanStack Start / vite + react** (web-app),
  **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **pnpm**, **Tailwind v4**, **zod**, **vitest**,
  **lucide** (icons), **shadcn/ui** (web-app components), **alpine** (some Astro
  marketing sites — e.g. sommerlawn-site uses `@astrojs/alpinejs` + `alpinejs`).
- A real web repo's `package.json` (sommerlawn-site) legitimately carries many
  extra deps (markdoc, mermaid, photoswipe, remark/rehype plugins, sitemap,
  astro-seo) and a large `pnpm.overrides` security-pin block + `auditConfig
  .ignoreCves`. **Do not flag** project-specific dependencies, overrides, or
  CVE-ignore entries — those are app decisions.

### 3.3 Drift from older template commits (recognition patterns for un-reconciled repos)

Repos generated from **pre-v3** harmon-init that haven't been reconciled show
these patterns. The platform/client reference repos were reconciled in 2026-06/07
and no longer do — keep the list for **other** older repos (pre-v3 personal or
client projects) an audit may target. These are **template-version lag**, not
violations of intent — a repo being *brought up to current standard* would update
them:

- **Symlink direction flipped:** live repos have `AGENTS.md -> CLAUDE.md` (and
  `GEMINI.md -> CLAUDE.md`), keeping the real content in `CLAUDE.md`. The current
  template makes **`AGENTS.md` canonical** with the others symlinked to it.
- **File extensions (not drift):** repos vary between `.yml` and `.yaml`
  (e.g. `Taskfile.yaml` vs `Taskfile.yml`). This is by design — use whichever
  extension each tool conventionally uses; never normalize or flag it.
- **Older docs layout:** live repos have flat top-level docs (`docs/security.md`,
  `docs/branchProtection.md` (camelCase!), `docs/containerUpdates.md`,
  `docs/dependencyUpdates.md`, `docs/architecture/architecture.md`) instead of the
  current `product/ architecture/{ci-cd,security,branch-protection,tests} guides/
  runbooks/` + kebab-case filenames. They lack `docs/product/`, `docs/guides/`,
  `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/conventions.md`.
- **Split CI workflows:** an older repo may split `build`/`security`/`validate`
  into separate workflow files where the current template consolidates
  lint+security+build-test into `build.yml`. NB: **harmon-infra retains** its
  split workflows, extra `deploy.yaml`/`mirror-devcontainer-base.yaml`, and
  self-hosted `contraption` runners as an **accepted permanent customization** —
  treat that as 3.2-class, not lag. (sommerlawn-site's old `-max` claude-workflow
  variants are gone; its extra `links-online.yml` is a legit addition.)
- **Older copier answer keys:** a pre-v3 `.copier-answers.yml` references
  now-renamed/removed questions (`github_collaboration_templates`,
  `run_task_bootstrap`, `project_url`).
- **Stale `requirements.txt`** alongside `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` — the current
  template is uv/pyproject-only. (Removed from harmon-infra 2026-07-03 once its
  last consumer, a legacy Snyk CI step, was dropped.)
- **Bare `typecheck` task** (no `lint:typescript`): repos rendered before the
  omator retro (harmon-init ≤ v3.23) predate the rename; the current template
  names it `lint:typescript` with a `typecheck` alias, so both invocations work
  after an update. Lefthook hook *names* legitimately stay `typecheck`.
- **1Password CLI feature in the BOT devcontainer profile:** pre-retro renders
  ship `ghcr.io/itsmechlark/features/1password` in both profiles; the current
  standard is **dev-profile only** (the bot container must hold no credential-
  store path, enforced by `devcontainer-assert.sh`). Unlike most 3.3 lag this
  one is security-relevant — recommend the update rather than just noting it.
- **Missing `secret:set:*` tasks / `scripts/secret-set-*.sh`, or a bare
  `npx --yes`-only `lint:markdown`/`format`:** pre-retro renders lack the
  destination-only secret helpers and the pinned-bin preference — `copier
  update` brings both in.

When auditing: distinguish "**legit conditional/stack difference**" (3.1, 3.2 —
leave alone) from "**template-version lag**" (3.3 — candidate for an update toward
the current convention, but not a correctness bug).
