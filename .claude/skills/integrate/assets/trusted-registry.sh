# trusted-registry.sh — materialize agent-registry.json at a revision the
# change under review cannot alter.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Both the write broker and the cloud-review checker
# resolve a finder's entry through this, and neither accepts a registry FILE
# from its caller. That distinction is the whole point (#804, trust constraints
# 1–3 from #796 challenge rounds 3 and 5):
#
#   C1: A caller-supplied --registry/--profile FILE hands the party the
#       broker constrains exactly the authority it removes: an integrator that
#       can write a temp file could declare any trigger body, reviewer login,
#       trusted actor and verdict classifier.
#   C2: Resolving the registry at the merge base via a local tracking ref
#       (refs/remotes/origin/<base>) is not a boundary: git update-ref can
#       move it, and the merge base becomes the PR head.
#   C3: Pinning the resolved profile into the cycle's own state file moves
#       the problem: the state is caller-writable, and the readiness gate
#       then takes the actor id from it.
#
# So the caller names only a finder SLUG. The revision is the PR's base
# commit, content-addressed from GitHub via `gh pr view --json baseRefOid` —
# the same boundary AGENTS.md's "Self-modified policy is read from the merge
# base" draws, but resolved from GitHub rather than a local ref. The registry
# is then read at that commit through the GitHub API, never from the worktree
# or a local object.
#
# Every failure is a refusal. There is no fallback to the worktree copy: a
# trigger posted from an unverified registry is exactly what this exists to
# prevent.
#
# Requires: gh, jq (each already required by both callers).
