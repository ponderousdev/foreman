# groom-report.sh — render the groom dispositions dataset (groom-verdicts.sh
# join output) into a self-contained HTML report and a Markdown summary.
# Read-only: writes only to the two output files named on its command line,
# never to GitHub. Deterministic — the same dataset renders byte-identical
# output (the generation timestamp is injectable via GROOM_NOW for tests), so
# the HTML can be republished to the same Artifact after every apply step
# (issue #1015).
#
# Section order (fixed, per issues #1015, #1061, #1062, #1063):
# Stats strip; Visualizations (inline SVG charts in HTML); What to do next;
# Close now (table, every entry showing number AND title); Milestones;
# Parent issues; Spec-worthy themes; Decisions (ranked into top five, next
# ten, remainder by area with callouts and response lines); Completed this run;
# Process findings (two-column table); Conformance; Bot-owned issues; Unverified (only when
# the dataset carries any — stats.unverified, from groom-verdicts.sh join
# --allow-missing); Every issue (full table with inline filter/search).
#
# Usage:
#   groom-report.sh render --dispositions PATH --out-html PATH --out-md PATH
#                           [--outcomes PATH]
#
# --outcomes PATH (optional) is a JSON Lines file of applied-write records
# written by groom-apply.sh/groom-decide.sh's own --outcomes flag:
#   {"issue":N,"op":"...","status":"DONE"|"DECIDED <date>","at":"<UTC>"}
# Outcomes are keyed by (issue, op), not by issue alone (Codex review on
# PR #1032, comment 4012885408): an issue can carry several approved
# operations (a retitle AND a close, say), or an apply run can fail partway
# through, and a status keyed by issue number only let ANY outcome for that
# issue overwrite the row's disposition regardless of which op it was for —
# a successful retitle followed by a failed close made a CLOSE-* row
# disappear from "Close now" and render as a completed close, even though the
# issue remained open. A row's `status` therefore comes only from the outcome
# of the op that matches its verdict — "close" for a CLOSE-* row, "decision"
# for a NEEDS-DECISION row — and every other recorded op (retitle, label,
# milestone-assign, sub-issue-link, blocked-by) never changes a row's status.
# The LAST record for a given (issue, op) pair overrides that row's `status`
# column — republishing the report after an apply step (SKILL.md Step 6)
# is otherwise a byte-identical re-render of the plan, forever showing
# PENDING no matter what was actually applied (finding 8).
# A --outcomes PATH that does not exist yet is an empty outcomes set (every
# row PENDING), noted on stderr rather than refused — the documented dry-run
# recipe (SKILL.md Step 6 item 3) points --outcomes at a file no apply step
# has written yet on its first render (challenge round 2 confirming round,
# finding 2). A PATH that exists but cannot be read is still an error.
#
# "Close now" and "Decisions" list only PENDING rows, and the Stats strip's
# close-candidate/decision counts and the "What to do next"/clean-backlog
# lines count PENDING rows only too: once outcomes are merged in, a DONE
# close or a DECIDED decision moves to the "Completed this run" section
# instead of continuing to render as still-actionable work on every
# successful post-apply re-render (Codex review on PR #1032, comment
# 4012242626). The clean-backlog line additionally requires
# stats.unverified to be empty — an incomplete audit (join --allow-missing)
# is never "clean", whatever the close/decision/finding counts say (Codex
# review on PR #1032, comment 4012242642).
#
# Every path argument (--dispositions, --outcomes, --out-html, --out-md) is
# canonicalized and, when GROOM_SCRATCH is set, must lie under it — exactly
# like groom-scan.sh's guard_out_path — refused (exit 4) otherwise.
# Interactive use with GROOM_SCRATCH unset is unchanged.
#
# Exit: 0 = rendered, 2 = usage/read error, 4 = refused (a path argument
#       outside GROOM_SCRATCH, when set, or GROOM_SCRATCH itself does not
#       exist).
