# ai/skills/universal/orchestrate/assets/test-consumer-pin-audit.sh — behavioral tests for the Dev flow v2 consumer
# pin contract (harmon-devkit#604, openspec/changes/dev-flow-v2 task 5.1):
#
#   * ai/skills/universal/orchestrate/assets/consumer-pin-audit.sh — does a repository's vendored-skill pin
#     agree with its .devflow.toml shape, and does it refuse both directions
#     of skew with the right instruction?
#   * ai/skills/universal/dev-flow-support/assets/devflow-policy.mjs — is a non-version-2 policy refused with ONE
#     actionable message naming `copier update` and the harmon-init release
#     that ships the version-2 template, and does a version-2 policy resolve?
#
# Fully hermetic and offline: builds throwaway consumer repositories in temp
# dirs from the shape fixtures already in ai/schemas/fixtures/exit/, so no
# case depends on this repository's own (still legacy) .devflow.toml or on its
# .claude/skills symlinks. Run via `task test:consumer-pin-audit`.
