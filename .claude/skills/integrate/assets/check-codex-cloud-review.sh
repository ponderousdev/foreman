# Persist and classify current-head Codex cloud-review evidence.

# This helper never writes to GitHub. The caller owns the explicit

#
# Exit codes from `check`:
#   0  clean
#   10 findings
#   11 pending
#   12 retry (attempt 1 timed out)
#   13 escalate (attempt 2 timed out)
#   14 PR no longer open — GitHub answered and the PR is MERGED or CLOSED;
#      terminal for the whole shepherd stage, never a wait-and-retry
#   2  indeterminate — malformed, changed head, usage error, or a
#      current-head verdict whose shape cannot be classified
#
# `settle` records the disposition of a badged finding that lives OUTSIDE an
# inline thread — a top-level conversation comment or a review body — because
# those two surfaces carry no reply linkage, so the in-thread adjudication path
# can never reach them and `check` would report `findings` for them forever.
#
# `reserve` creates the state a cycle runs on; `reap` is the other half of that
# lifecycle. Nothing else removes a state file — a shepherded PR is still open
# when its session stops, so a cycle can never reap its own state, and without
# a sweep the directory grows by one file per PR forever. `reap` exits 0 for a
# completed sweep whatever it found — kept and skipped entries are results, not
# failures, so a caller can run it unconditionally — and 2 only when it cannot
# complete a sweep at all (usage error, unusable root).

Usage:
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh reserve --state FILE --repo OWNER/REPO --pr N --head SHA --attempt 1|2 [--finder SLUG]
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh attach --state FILE --trigger-id N
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh attach --state FILE --requested-at ISO8601
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh check --state FILE [--actor-id N] [--actor-login LOGIN] [--timeout-min N] [--now ISO8601]
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh settle --state FILE --actor-id N --surface comment|review --id N --disposition declined|filed --note TEXT [--covers N] [--now ISO8601]
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh show --state FILE
  check-codex-cloud-review.sh reap --root DIR [--budget-sec N]

When --finder is given on reserve, actor identity and verdict classification
are driven by the finder's profile in the trusted registry (C1-C3).

`check` exits 0 clean, 10 findings, 11 pending, 12 retry, 13 escalate,
14 PR no longer open, 2 indeterminate. Exit 14 means GitHub answered and
the PR is MERGED or CLOSED: terminal for the whole shepherd stage — stop,
never wait, re-run, or re-trigger. A PR fetch that FAILS is still the
transient bounded-wait path (pending/retry/escalate); only a non-open
answer is 14. `reserve` and `attach` refuse a non-open PR outright,
exit 2 with a reason naming the reported state.

State locks are never reclaimed automatically. On lock-held, inspect the
reported PID and age; removing a lock directory is an explicit human recovery
action performed outside this helper.

# harmon-devkit#223: the timeout governing an attempt cycle used to live only
# in whatever `--timeout-min` a caller happened to pass, so `check
# --timeout-min 10` could return `retry` after ten minutes while the
# documented attempt-2 `reserve` — which takes no timeout of its own — was
# still enforcing the 15-minute default window for another five. The fix
# distinguishes ABSENCE (no command has ever chosen a timeout for this cycle)
# from a PERSISTED CHOICE (one has), and only the latter is authoritative:
#
#   - persisted is a number: that value governs. An explicit --timeout-min
#     that disagrees is a usage error (a second vote), not a silent switch.
#   - persisted is absent/null and --timeout-min was NOT passed: fall back to
#     the unmodified 15-minute default, unpersisted — still no choice made.
#   - persisted is absent/null and --timeout-min WAS passed: ADOPT it. This
#     is the documented convention itself — `reserve` (no flag) followed by
#     `check --timeout-min 10` must keep working, so the first explicit value
#     any command supplies for an otherwise-undecided cycle becomes that
#     cycle's timeout from here on. The caller persists the adoption
#     (`timeout_min_adopted=1` signals it must write `.timeout_min` back)
#     rather than this function, because writing state requires the caller's
#     already-held lock and read state file.
#
# Adopting is safe to do retroactively (not just before any `check` has run)
# because nothing about a `check` verdict is durable: every command
# re-derives `elapsed` from `requested_at` and `timeout_min` fresh, on its own
# invocation, against the real clock. There is no cached "attempt 1 timed
# out" decision anywhere in state for a later adoption to contradict — only
# `requested_at` (fixed at attachment) and `timeout_min` (this cycle's
# budget) are persisted, and adoption keeps those two mutually consistent for
# every command that reads them afterward. The one case that DOES get a
# second vote is two conflicting EXPLICIT flags — that is not absence
# resolving, it is genuine disagreement about the cycle's timeout, so it
# stays a `die`.
#
# `$1` is the raw `.timeout_min` from the state file: empty both for state
# written before this field existed (no key at all) and for a cycle that has
# never had an explicit choice adopted into it (the key is present as JSON
# `null`) — `jq -r '.timeout_min // empty'` collapses both to the empty
# string, and this function treats them identically, which is the point:
# neither has made a durable choice yet.

          # decision.
          #
          # Three earlier revisions tried to prove the trailing clause was
          # praise — by rejecting caveat shapes, then by requiring a praise
          # word, then by requiring every word to be recognised. Each looked
          # airtight and each was fail-OPEN within minutes of review
          # ("Tests fail on Windows.", "Nice work, tests crash on Windows.",
          # ":warning:", "Work on it."). The clause is free text that Codex
          # writes differently every time; it is not a channel that can be
          # parsed reliably, and the allowlist that preceded those attempts
          # could not converge either — seven distinct clauses, three inside
          # twenty-five minutes, and it deadlocked the PR that was fixing it.
          #
          # So the tail is not load-bearing. What decides the verdict is the
          # part of Codex's output that does NOT vary:
          #
          #   1. the verdict sentence itself, matched exactly;
          #   2. the absence of any severity badge ANYWHERE in the body —
          #      every finding Codex has ever posted here carried one,
          #      including the observed P3;
          #   3. every remaining line being Codex's own metadata.
          #
          # Inline comments on the current head are classified as findings
          # separately, before this runs.
          #
          # The residual, stated plainly: a concern that is unbadged, absent
          # from the inline comments, and appended to a sentence that says the
          # opposite would pass. That has never been observed — it requires
          # Codex to contradict itself mid-line — and this gate promotes a
          # draft to ready-for-review rather than merging, so a human still
          # reads the PR. That is a better trade than a parser that has been
          # wrong three times.
          # Used only by the review-settlement gate in `check`, but defined
          # here so they share `body_text`, the About-block removal, and the
          # Reviewed-commit pattern with `verdict_class` instead of growing a
          # parallel set of regexes that could drift apart. A findings review's
          # body is a CARRIER: a heading, one fixed sentence, and Codex's own
          # metadata, with the findings themselves in the inline comments.
          # Anything else in it is prose nobody has answered.
          #
          # These defs work off `carrier_lines`, NOT `first_line`, because a
          # real findings-review body begins with a BLANK LINE:
          # "\n### 💡 Codex Review\n\n…" is what #355 and #273 actually posted.
          # `first_line` is therefore empty for every genuine findings review,
          # and a heading test built on it can never match one — the gate would
          # be permanently inert, re-blocking every PR and reproducing the #275
          # deadlock from the fail-closed side.
          #
          # `first_line` itself is deliberately LEFT ALONE. It serves
          # `verdict_class`'s clean-verdict prefix test, and clean results are
          # top-level comments that open directly with the verdict sentence —
          # a different payload shape from these review bodies, with no leading
          # blank observed. Loosening the shared def to fix a review-body
          # problem would change what counts as a clean verdict too, for no
          # evidence that the clean path needs it.
          #
          # The heading match is loose about what sits between the hashes and
          # the words — "### Codex Review" and "### 💡 Codex Review" have both
          # been observed — and strict about the words themselves.
          #
          # The sentence is pinned as the literal observed on
          # evanharmon1/harmon-devkit#355. Pinning cuts the other way from the
          # verdict-line clause deliberately: this is the SETTLED path, so a
          # reworded sentence fails to match, the review is not settled, and
          # the check re-blocks. Drift in Codex's format costs a false block,

    # A reconstructed reservation can be newer than the trigger attached to
    # it even though an earlier trigger already exists for this head. Detect
    # that history from one issue-comment read.
    #
    # The lower boundary for "same-head history" needs a timestamp GitHub
    # itself assigned, not one the committer wrote. Trigger comments carry no
    # head field, so harmon-devkit#1014's original version fell back to the
    # current commit's author/committer dates as a "conservative" boundary —
    # but those are client-controlled: a commit dated at or after a real
    # prior trigger hides that trigger from reconstruction entirely.
    #
    # The head's earliest check-suite `created_at` is server time,
    # un-spoofable by the committer — but challenge round 1 (2026-09-14,
    # confirmed harmon-devkit#1014 finding challenge-r1-codex-adversarial-1)
    # found that PREFERRING a check-run's `started_at` outright whenever any
    # check run exists — replacing the commit-date boundary rather than
    # combining the two — reopens the exact regression class this boundary
    # exists to close, via ordinary CI timing rather than a spoofed date.
    # Fixed with `min(commit-date boundary, earliest check-run started_at)`.
    #
    # Integration remediation 1 (2026-09-14, Codex cloud review on `a5bc99a`,
    # confirmed finding `4010207979`) found a COMBINED case that `min()` over
    # check-run `started_at` still does not close: when the commit dates are
    # ALSO future-dated (spoofed later than reality) AND a trusted trigger is
    # posted before CI has started its first RUN, `min()` still picks the
    # check-run boundary (since it is earlier than the inflated commit
    # dates) — but that boundary is itself later than the genuine trigger,
    # because a check RUN's `started_at` carries real CI-queue/startup
    # latency on top of when GitHub actually received the push. A check
    # SUITE (the envelope check runs belong to) is created essentially the
    # instant GitHub processes the push, before any run inside it has had a
    # chance to start — a tighter, still-unspoofable proxy for "when this
    # commit became the head" than any individual run's start time. Using
    # the earliest check-suite `created_at` instead of the earliest
    # check-run `started_at` closes this combined gap while keeping the same
    # `min()` structure (still defeats a plain commit-date spoof) and the
    # same fallback (commit dates alone, when no check suite exists at all).
    # `commit_date_boundary`/`check_suite_boundary` name both compared inputs
    # in state (the latter `null` when no check suite exists), and
    # `boundary_source` names only which one actually won the comparison — a
    # later reader can audit the comparison itself rather than trust a
    # single opaque label.
    #
    # KNOWN RESIDUAL (harmon-devkit#1030, Codex cycle 2 on `30b613c`,
    # confirmed finding `4010671547`, adjudicated P2 — a residual of the
    # timestamp approach itself, not a defect in this change): when the
    # commit dates are ALSO future-dated AND the trusted trigger is posted
    # before the first check SUITE exists (not merely before the first
    # run), every available lower bound — commit dates and check-suite
    # creation alike — postdates the trigger, so it is filtered out and
    # `requires_full_window` stays false. No further timestamp refinement
    # closes this: the trigger genuinely precedes every server-side signal
    # available at reconstruction time. #1030 tracks the structural fix —
    # on a reservation with no prior local state for the head, treat any
    # other trusted `@codex review` comment on the PR, posted after the
    # previous head's last accepted result (or, absent such a record, any
    # at all), as a prior trigger regardless of its timestamp ordering
    # against commit or check-suite creation.

    # Current-head inline findings are PARTITIONED, not counted

    # finding re-blocked every later check until a new commit moved the head,
    # which is the opposite of what the shepherd stage asks for — a finding is
    # settled by fixing it OR by declining it with reasoning in its thread.
    #
    # A bot inline comment on this head is ADJUDICATED when its own thread
    # carries a trusted reply posted after it. The replies come from the SAME
    # `pulls/<n>/comments` listing already fetched, because a reply to a review
    # comment IS an inline comment — it is the same resource with
    # `in_reply_to_id` set to the comment it answers. There is no second
    # endpoint to fetch and no GraphQL thread walk needed.
    #
    # Trust is `author_association` in {OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR} OR the
    # reply's immutable numeric user ID equalling the PR author's. The
    # association alone is not enough: a shepherd driving a fork PR replies as
    # the PR author with association CONTRIBUTOR, and refusing that would make
    # the contract unfinishable again for exactly the sessions this helper
    # exists to serve. The bot may never adjudicate itself.
    #
    # What a reply SAYS is deliberately not examined, and that is a knowingly
    # accepted residual: a content-free trusted reply — "looking into it" —
    # adjudicates the finding just as a reasoned decline does. Requiring an
    # explicit disposition would mean parsing reply prose for intent, which is
    # the exact failure family documented at length above `verdict_class`, and
    # issue #275's acceptance criterion is reply-from-a-trusted-actor, not
    # reply-content. It also matches what SKILL.md §2 already says about the
    # main thread check: it measures whether a thread has been answered, never
    # who thought about it. The cost is bounded because this gate promotes a
    # draft to ready-for-review rather than merging, so a human still reads the
    # disposition that now stands on the PR.
    #
    # Malformed or missing fields on a would-be trusted reply — no numeric user
    # ID, no association, an unparseable timestamp — make that reply untrusted,
    # so the comment stays UNADJUDICATED and the check reports `findings`. That
    # is the opposite of `verdict_class`, where unparseable means indeterminate,
    # and deliberately so: an unreadable verdict says nothing about whether the
    # PR is clean, but an unreadable reply is simply not proof that a human
    # answered the finding. Fail-closed here points at `findings`.
    #
    # The edited-since-reply rule compares the bot comment's `updated_at`
    # against the LATEST trusted reply's `created_at`. Codex edits a finding in
    # place when it revises it, and a reply that predates the edit answered
    # different text — so an edited comment whose replies are all older is
    # unresolved again. `updated_at` absent means never edited and falls back to
    # `created_at`; present but unparseable fails closed, like every other
    # malformed field here.
    #
    # That comparison is STRICT. GitHub timestamps are second-precision, so a
    # reply stamped the same second as an edit cannot prove it came after the
    # edit — and a tie resolved in the reply's favour would silently adjudicate
    # text the replier may never have seen. The never-edited case is unaffected:
    # `updated_at` then equals `created_at`, and a trusted reply is already
    # required to be strictly later than that.
    #
    # The partition also records which REVIEW each finding belongs to, via the
    # inline comment's `pull_request_review_id`. A review is settled only by its
    # OWN findings — see the correlation comment above the review gate below.
    # A current-head bot inline comment carrying no numeric
    # `pull_request_review_id` cannot be attributed to anything, so it settles
    # nothing at all: the whole settled set collapses to empty rather than
    # letting an unattributable finding be counted against some other review.

    # Pick the newest accepted current-head result after the latest trigger.
    # This is ordering, not attempt attribution: earlier attempts and pending
    # acknowledgements have no bearing on the decision. An empty review is an
    # ordering result only when current-head inline findings attribute to its
    # exact ID; an unattributed shell remains pending evidence below.
    #
    # Each candidate is tagged with its `surface` (review/comment/reaction).
    # Ids from different GitHub resource types are not chronologically
    # comparable — a review id and a comment id are drawn from unrelated
    # sequences — so when the newest timestamp is shared by candidates from
    # more than one surface, that tie is unresolvable here and `tie:true`
    # says so (harmon-devkit#1014 ruling 4, Codex cycle-1 finding
    # `4007296539`); a same-surface tie is still broken by id, same as
    # before. The bash `tie` check below acts on this only once every
    # non-codex finder mode has already exited, so this flag never changes
    # CodeRabbit/Copilot behavior.
    #
    # Integration remediation 1 (2026-09-14, Codex cloud review on `a5bc99a`,
    # confirmed finding `4010207991`) found two compounding problems with the
    # tie exit as it stood: (1) a `settle`d review/comment is never excluded
    # from tie consideration, so once a human disposes of the finding behind
    # a cross-surface tie, the exact same tie recurs on every later check —
    # an immutable indeterminate result the settlement can never clear,
    # reopening the #275 deadlock class this file works hard everywhere else
    # to avoid; (2) a tie where one side carries an actual badged finding
    # exited indeterminate before the review/comment classifiers below ever
    # got a chance to surface it as `findings`, discarding a concrete result
    # in favor of a shrug.
    #
    # Fixed by tagging each candidate `disposed` (its id is in
    # `disposed_reviews`/`disposed_comments`) rather than dropping it from
    # the array outright: a disposed candidate is answered, not a live
    # contender for "which surface is newest," but it must still be able to
    # BE `newest_result` on its own — the pre-existing `disposed_applied`
    # terminal-clean exit further below depends on a solo disposed finding
    # (nothing else posted on this head) still resolving to its own
    # time/id, exactly as before this fix. So disposed candidates are
    # excluded only from the *diversity* check that decides whether a tie is
    # genuinely live (`$top_live`), never from the candidate pool itself:
    # when nothing live ties with it, a disposed candidate (or several
    # disposed candidates sharing one surface) still resolves normally,
    # same-surface id-tiebreak included; when it ties with something live
    # from a different surface, only the live side counts toward "is this
    # ambiguous," and an `actionable` (severity-badged) live candidate is
    # preferred over declaring an unresolvable tie — findings dominate an
    # ambiguous ordering the same way they already dominate everywhere else
    # in this file. This flag does not itself have to name the single
    # correct finding — not declaring `tie:true` is enough for control to
    # reach the independent `review_result`/`comment_result` classifiers
    # below, which detect and cite the real finding on their own regardless
    # of what `newest_result` pointed at. A live tie with no actionable side
    # is still genuinely unresolvable and still exits indeterminate exactly
    # as before.

    # Classifying a current-head result is three-way, not binary, because
    # "I cannot tell" is a real answer and reporting it as `findings` is a lie
    # that costs a clean PR its gate.
    #
    # The two Codex formats are structurally disjoint. A clean verdict is a
    # top-level comment whose first line is "Codex Review: Didn't find any
    # major issues." plus a praise clause. Findings are a review body opening
    # "### Codex Review", and the findings themselves are INLINE comments
    # carrying a severity badge — which are rejected before this point. So the
    # prefix is the real signal, and the trailing clause is decoration.
    #
    # Equality on the whole line was the original bug: Codex always appends
    # praise, so it never matched and no PR could satisfy the gate. Screening
    # the tail for "no colon, no digit" replaced it and was not a boundary
    # either — it admitted "… issues. However a race remains". Narrowing to a
    # short exclamation then rejected the real reply "… issues. Chef's kiss."
    # Each rule traded one failure direction for the other because it was
    # trying to read intent out of free text.
    #
    #   * does not open with the verdict sentence   -> findings
    #   * carries a severity marker anywhere        -> findings
    #   * a later line is not Codex's own metadata  -> INDETERMINATE
    #   * otherwise                                 -> clean
    #
    # The trailing clause is NOT one of those tests, and there is no list of
    # praise strings here to extend. Two families of rule were tried in that
    # position and both shipped broken. An allowlist of observed praise could
    # not converge — eight distinct clauses, three of them inside twenty-five
    # minutes — and it deadlocked the PR that was extending it, because that
    # PR's own clause was unlisted. The shape test that replaced it was
    # revised three times and was fail-OPEN each time within minutes of
    # review ("Tests fail on Windows.", "Nice work, tests crash on Windows.",
    # ":warning:", "Work on it."). Length separates nothing in either
    # direction: the longest observed praise, "already looking forward to the
    # next diff.", is 41 characters, and the caveat "But a race remains." is
    # 19.
    #
    # So the decision rests only on the parts of Codex's output that do not
    # vary. The full reasoning, and the residual this knowingly accepts, are
    # in the comment above `verdict_class`. Do not add a fourth attempt at
    # parsing the clause here — the residual is tracked as
    # evanharmon1/harmon-devkit#285.
    #
    # The verdict LINE is not the whole story either: a concern parked further
    # down the body carries no badge, so constraining only the first line let
    # "…issues. Keep it up!\n\nHowever a race remains." read as clean.
    # Everything after the verdict line must therefore be Codex's own metadata
    # — the "Reviewed commit" line and its collapsed About block — and any
    # other prose makes the result indeterminate.
    #
    # The About block is REMOVED rather than truncated at. Cutting the body at
    # the first "<details" validated only the text before it, so a concern
    # appended after the closing tag was invisible. An unterminated block does
    # not match the removal and its contents then fail the check, which is the
    # right direction.
    #
    # Removal is anchored on the block's SUMMARY, not on "<details" alone.
    # Discarding any collapsed block would let a concern hide inside one. The
    # summary is a stable identifier; the block's body is Codex's prose and is
    # deliberately not asserted on, because a reworded boilerplate would then
    # fail the gate on every PR. Residual, accepted knowingly: unbadged text
    # inside the genuine About block passes. A BADGED finding does not —
    # has_severity_marker scans the whole body, block included.
    #
    # And the metadata line is matched WHOLE. `startswith` on the label
    # accepted "**Reviewed commit:** `sha` However a race remains.", which is
    # the same trailing-text hole as the verdict line had, one line lower.
    # A Codex findings review is a body opening "### Codex Review" whose actual
    # findings ARE the inline comments partitioned above — `verdict_class` calls
    # that body `findings` because it does not open with the clean sentence. So
    # once a review's own findings are adjudicated, re-blocking on the review
    # that carried them would make the relaxation pointless: the same settled
    # findings, counted a second time from the other side.
    #
    # The correlation is PER REVIEW, via the `pull_request_review_id` each
    # inline comment carries. Same-head aggregation is not enough, and the
    # two-attempt contract makes the counterexample routine rather than exotic:
    # two findings reviews on one head, the first with adjudicated inline
    # comments and the second stating its finding in the review body alone. A
    # global "something was adjudicated" flag suppresses BOTH, and the check
    # reports adjudicated-clean over an unanswered finding.
    #
    # So a findings-classified current-head review is settled only when it has
    # at least one current-head bot inline comment attributed to it AND every
    # such comment is adjudicated. A findings review with nothing attributed to
    # it is never in the settled set, which subsumes the earlier rule about a
    # findings review with no inline comments at all. A settled review
    # contributes neither `findings` nor `clean` to the aggregate below — it is
    # answered, not a verdict — so an `unrecognized` sibling is still seen.
    #
    # One more condition, and it is not optional: a review whose BODY carries a
    # severity badge is never settled by its inline comments, however well
    # adjudicated those are. Codex states some findings in the review body
    # itself, and attribution cannot reach them — there is no inline comment to
    # reply to — so reclassifying the whole review on the strength of its
    # attributed comments would discard the badged one in silence.
    #
    # That test is `has_severity_marker`, the same whole-body scan
    # `verdict_class` uses, and it is deliberately content-NEGATIVE: it asks
    # whether a stable, machine-emitted badge is ABSENT, never what the prose
    # means. It therefore does not reopen the free-text failure family
    # documented above `verdict_class` — nothing here reads a clause, ranks a
    # phrasing, or maintains a corpus of observed wording.
    #
    # The badge test alone is not enough, for the reason the residual above
    # `verdict_class` records: an UNBADGED concern carries no marker. So a
    # settled review's body must additionally be CARRIER-ONLY — heading, the
    # pinned boilerplate sentence, whole-line Reviewed-commit metadata, the
    # About block, and nothing else non-blank (`is_carrier_only`). Between the
    # two tests the settled path has no free-text surface at all: a badge makes
    # it `findings`, and any other prose makes it not-settled, which is also
    # `findings`.
    #
    # Both failure directions therefore RE-BLOCK. If Codex rewords its
    # boilerplate or restyles its heading, settlement stops matching and the
    # check gates a PR it could have released; it never releases one it should
    # have gated. That is the opposite trade from the verdict line, where
    # pinning the tail deadlocked real PRs — there the strict reading was
    # fail-closed toward *blocking clean work*, here it is fail-closed toward
    # blocking work that still has an open finding.
    # `body_text != ""` drops EMPTY-BODY reviews from verdict classification,
    # and only from verdict classification. GitHub auto-creates a body-less
    # COMMENTED review
    # shell to carry inline comments (reply shells, and Codex's own shell
    # posted before its inline findings land), and an empty body is no
    # evidence in either direction: it has no verdict to be clean and no
    # free-text surface where an unanswered concern could hide — anything it
    # carries is inline comments, which the inline gate above already
    # classifies on their own. Once those comments attribute to its exact
    # review ID, the review timestamp orders their adjudicated result; an
    # unattributed shell remains no result at all. Classifying the shell itself
    # would read it as
    # `findings` (no clean opening sentence) and hard-block a cycle whose
    # real review has not arrived yet. `fetched_reviews` below deliberately
    # still includes shells: inline comments attribute to them by review ID,
    # and dropping the ID would make those comments read as naming a review
    # nobody fetched.
    # A DANGLING shell — an empty-body current-head review by the actor with
    # no inline comment attributed to it — is a review still in flight:
    # Codex posts the shell first and its verdict or findings only after, so
    # clean evidence OLDER than the newest dangling shell may be about to be
    # contradicted and is not accepted, while evidence NEWER than the shell
    # stands (that is the normal shell -> verdict order, so an abandoned
    # shell ages out instead of deadlocking the cycle). Every clean exit
    # below compares its own evidence timestamp against this barrier;
    # GitHub's ISO-8601 UTC strings compare correctly as strings.

    # body — `verdict_class` needs body text — so an EMPTY-body review whose
    # inline findings are fully adjudicated never appears in it at all, even
    # though `newest_result_record` above already orders such a review ahead
    # of an older non-empty one (see its own "ordering, not attempt
    # attribution" comment). When that happens, `review_result` can read
    # "clean" from the older review while `newest_result` correctly points at
    # the newer, adjudicated one; forcing the clean branch below to match
    # `newest_result` against the OLDER review's evidence then bounded-waits
    # forever, because the older review can never become the newest one it
    # already lost to. The same shape applies to a NON-empty review too: a
    # findings review whose inline findings are fully adjudicated is
    # reclassified to "settled" (not "clean") by `review_result_record`
    # above, so it likewise falls out of `review_result` while still being
    # able to win `newest_result` on the strength of its non-empty body.
    # Detect either case directly — `newest_result` names a review that is a
    # member of `$settled_reviews`, the inline-reply-adjudication set — and
    # skip the clean branch so control reaches the existing
    # `adjudicated_findings` branch below instead. This is a pure exclusion:
    # it can only prevent entering the clean branch, never cause it to fire
    # when it wouldn't have otherwise.

    # for one and demands `--covers 2` for the ordinary single-finding case,
    # breaking the documented invocation. Matching the alt-text form counts
    # each badge once. A body that states findings as plain prose renders no
    # badge at all, so that shape falls back to the token scan, which is
    # correct for it; `has_severity_marker` above has already established that
    # at least one finding is present either way.
