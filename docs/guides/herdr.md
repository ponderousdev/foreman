# Herdr — workspaces, panes, agents, and multi-harness orchestration

Herdr is the agent-session runtime for this repo's agents — in the
devcontainers where the profile ships them, and on your own machine: a
terminal workspace manager that recognizes the coding agent running
in each pane, tracks its state, and exposes the whole thing through the
`herdr` CLI. This guide is how to *use* it for real work — the mental model,
the everyday workflows, how it pairs with the repo's worktree tooling, running
several agents (and several harnesses) at once, and the lifecycle and cleanup
that keep the sidebar meaningful. Installation, the devcontainer volumes, and
attaching from a laptop are in [devcontainers.md](devcontainers.md) § Persistent
agent sessions. Coder bot-container access, the remote-attach target, Herdr
version matching, and the stale-image rebuild gotcha are in
[Bot-profile access from Coder](devcontainers.md#bot-profile-access-from-coder).
the
decision rule for worktrees is [worktrees.md](worktrees.md).

The installed binary is the authority for syntax: `herdr --help`, then a
command group without a subcommand (`herdr agent`, `herdr pane`, …) prints its
commands. Agents inside Herdr have a vendored skill for this (`herdr --skill`);
what follows is the human's map of the same ground.

## The five nouns and how they relate

| Noun | What it is | ID shape | Created by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Workspace** | A project root: a directory (or a worktree) plus its tabs | `w1` | `herdr workspace create --cwd PATH` or `herdr worktree create/open` |
| **Tab** | A layout page inside a workspace | `w1:t1` | `herdr tab create --workspace w1` |
| **Pane** | One terminal (shell) inside a tab | `w1:p1` | `herdr pane split --pane ID --direction right` or `down` |
| **Agent** | The coding agent Herdr recognizes *occupying* a pane | pane ID or a unique name | `herdr agent start NAME --kind KIND --pane ID` |
| **Session** | A whole Herdr server (the `default` one, or `herdr --session NAME`) | name | `herdr` / `herdr --session NAME` |

The relationships that matter:

- **A pane exists whether or not it hosts an agent.** `pane run` drives an
  ordinary shell; `agent start` requires an *available* shell pane (at its
  prompt, nothing in the foreground) and never creates layout itself.
- **An agent is a full, independent process in its pane** — a real `claude`,
  `codex`, `agy`, `opencode`, … session with its own context, auth, and
  permissions. Its lifetime is the pane's: close the pane and it dies.
- **A name follows the pane's current occupant** and is cleared when that
  agent exits. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` and be unique among
  live agents; agent commands accept a name or the hosting pane ID, never a
  terminal ID or a bare kind.
- **Two kinds of workspace.** `workspace create` makes a plain
  directory-rooted workspace — no git involvement. `worktree create` makes a
  git worktree *and* a workspace rooted at it, and records the binding; one
  worktree ↔ one workspace. Creating a workspace never creates a worktree;
  creating a worktree always creates a workspace.
- **Caller context.** Herdr injects `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID`, `HERDR_TAB_ID`,
  `HERDR_PANE_ID` into every managed pane (and `HERDR_ENV=1`). Prefer
  `--current` or an explicit ID; an omitted target may resolve to the
  UI-focused pane, which can be someone else's.

## Agent lifecycle states

Herdr classifies a pane's agent by watching its terminal:

- `working` — producing output / running tools.
- `blocked` — Herdr recognized an approval or question UI; it needs input.
- `idle` — ready for input, and its tab has been *seen* in the focused UI.
- `done` — the same underlying idle state after unseen background work
  finished. Focusing the tab or targeting the pane/agent with a focus command
  marks it seen; CLI reads do not. `done` is therefore the sidebar's
  "to-review" queue.
- `unknown` — an agent is present but Herdr cannot classify it confidently.
  It does **not** mean finished.

`herdr agent explain <target>` shows which detection rule fired and on what
evidence — the first thing to run when a state looks wrong.

## Everyday workflows

**One agent, one repo (the default).** Open or attach with `herdr`, create a
workspace for the repo if it is not there, start the agent in the root pane
(or just run `claude` in the shell — Herdr recognizes it either way). Use
tabs for parallel *contexts* (a second agent on a different task, a shell for
logs), panes within a tab for things you want side by side.

**A second pane for a command or a helper agent, keeping your focus:**

```bash
herdr pane split --current --direction right --cwd "$PWD" --no-focus
#   → read .result.pane.pane_id
herdr pane run <id> "task verify && echo VERIFY-OK-7f3a || echo VERIFY-FAILED-7f3a"
herdr pane wait-output <id> --regex "VERIFY-(OK|FAILED)-7f3a" --timeout 600000
herdr pane read <id> --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

Split a wide pane right and a tall one down; avoid repeated same-direction
splits that leave unusable slivers. `pane run` sends text plus Enter
atomically; `wait-output` matches the current snapshot immediately, so output
that already exists counts. Wait on a marker *you* append (unique per run, one
alternative per outcome, as above) — most tasks print no stable "done" line of
their own, and a wait that only matches success sits silent through a failure.

**Starting and steering an agent in that pane:**

```bash
herdr agent start reviewer --kind codex --pane <id> -- <native args…>
herdr agent prompt reviewer "Review the current diff; report only actionable findings." --wait --timeout 600000
herdr agent read reviewer --source recent-unwrapped --lines 120
```

Native agent arguments go after `--`. `agent prompt --wait` returns at the
first settled `idle`/`done`/`blocked`; `--until STATE` is for state-specific
waits. A prompt sent from a non-working state must produce an observed state
change within about five seconds or Herdr returns `agent_prompt_stalled`
rather than waiting forever. If a wait returns `blocked`, `agent get` /
`agent read` first, then `agent send-keys` (logical keys — `esc`, `ctrl+c`,
`enter`) or `agent attach` to take the pane over yourself.

**Reading long answers.** Many harnesses render on the alternate screen, and
rows that leave it never enter Herdr's scrollback — raising `--lines` cannot
recover them. Ask the agent to write its full answer to a file and reply with
the path, then read the file.

## Worktrees

Herdr's `worktree create` is `git worktree add` plus a workspace, checked out
under `[worktrees] directory` (default `~/.herdr/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`);
`worktree open` binds an *existing* checkout to a new workspace; `worktree
list` shows worktrees for the repo, including ones Herdr did not create;
`worktree remove --workspace ID [--force]` tears down the workspace — tabs,
panes, sessions — **and deletes the checkout** with a plain `git worktree
remove` (no ignored-file guard). There is **no post-create
hook**: a fresh tree has no dependencies installed, no local env, and no
hooks proof, which is the failure everyone hits first.

So for repos generated from this template, **the repo creates and Herdr
binds**:

```bash
task worktree:new -- feat-x --branch feat/x
herdr worktree open --path .worktrees/feat-x --label feat-x --no-focus
# …work…
herdr workspace close <id>                 # panes + sessions; checkout stays
task worktree:rm -- feat-x                 # guarded removal, gitlink prune
```

Order matters: `herdr worktree remove` would delete the checkout before
`task worktree:rm` could refuse on ignored local state such as a `.env`, so a
repo-created tree is closed on the Herdr side and removed by the repo task.
Reserve `herdr worktree remove` for throwaway trees Herdr itself created.

If you use `herdr worktree create` directly, provision before any agent
starts: `herdr pane run <root-pane> "task install"` and `wait-output` for it,
then `agent start`. Environment variables are the only "setup" Herdr itself
offers — `workspace create`, `tab create`, and `pane split` take
`--env KEY=VALUE` (`worktree create` does **not**; give a worktree-backed
workspace its variables on the tabs/panes you create inside it) — and they
are the right place for gate variables an orchestrator sets under explicit
human authorization (never in the worker's prompt). When to reach for a worktree at all is [worktrees.md](worktrees.md).

## Fan-out: orchestrating many workers from one session

A Claude Code (or any) session running inside a Herdr pane can act as an
**orchestrator**: it shells out to `herdr` to create panes, start workers,
prompt them, wait, and harvest. The orchestrator is just another agent in
another pane; Herdr has no parent/child concept — the topology is conversational.

**Subagents versus pane workers.** These are different things and the words
matter:

- A **subagent** (Claude Code's `Agent` tool, `.claude/agents/*.md`) runs
  *inside* the parent session's process: its own context window, no terminal,
  one structured return value, dies when done. Only the parent can talk to
  it, and Herdr cannot see it — there is no pane to watch.
- A **pane worker** (a "worker session", "sibling agent", "teammate") is a
  full independent session in its own pane, with its own harness, login, and
  permissions. Herdr sees it, you can click into it, steer it, or take it
  over, and it can outlive or ignore the orchestrator. Results come back as
  terminal text and files, not a typed return.

Use subagents for cheap, fast, structured fan-outs you do not need to watch;
use pane workers when you want visibility, steerability, longer-running work,
or a **different harness** than the orchestrator's.

**Panes are not a security boundary.** Every pane worker runs as the same OS
user in the same Herdr session: any of them can read, type into, or close any
other pane by explicit ID, and they share the filesystem and every credential
on it. "Its own permissions" means each harness's own tool-approval settings,
not isolation. Fan out only mutually trusted workers over trusted inputs;
work that chews on untrusted content (third-party repos, inbound issue text)
belongs in a separate user, container, or VM, not a sibling pane.

**The loop** (each step is a `herdr` command the orchestrator runs):

1. **Lay out** — a fresh tab for the fan-out, one pane per unit, each with
   its cwd (a worktree for work that edits the repo; the checkout itself for
   pane jobs): `tab create --workspace … --label … --no-focus`, then
   `pane split … --cwd … --no-focus`; `--env` for any authorized gate variables.
2. **Start** — `agent start <name> --kind <kind> --pane <id> -- <native args>`
   with a distinctive name per unit (`triage-omator`, `prune-site`).
3. **Prompt** — one self-contained brief per worker, ending with a
   **file-based report** at a known path and a **sentinel line** printed
   last. Make both unique per *attempt*, not just per worker — a nonce such
   as `TRIAGE-DONE omator 7f3a` in the sentinel and the report filename —
   because `pane wait-output` matches the existing snapshot immediately, so
   a reused pane's previous sentinel satisfies the next wait and hands you
   the old report. Then
   `agent prompt … --wait --until working --timeout 30000`. If it returns
   with the worker still `idle`, delivery may have silently missed — Herdr
   before 0.8.2 could report `agent start` ready before the pane's first-run
   prompts have settled (fixed in 0.8.2, which the devcontainer image now
   pins), and a harness mid-render swallows input the same way — but before
   re-sending, check the pane and the report path: a fast worker can finish
   and return to
   `idle` inside the window, and re-sending a brief that performs side
   effects (GitHub writes, deploys) is at-least-once delivery. Re-send only
   when the pane shows the prompt never landed; make briefs idempotent where
   you can.
4. **Wait** — `agent wait <name> --timeout <ms>` per worker (background it;
   rounds run minutes), or `pane wait-output --match <sentinel> --timeout
   <ms>` where detection is weak. Always bound the wait: a worker whose
   detection stays `unknown` or whose harness hangs would otherwise block
   the orchestrator forever. On timeout, `agent get` / `agent read` /
   `agent explain` it and decide — nudge, take over, or retire — rather than
   waiting again blind. `done`/`idle` means *stopped*, not *succeeded*: the
   sentinel and the report file are the success signals.
5. **Harvest and verify** — `agent read` / read the report files, then
   **verify ground truth yourself** (the diff, the labels on GitHub, the test
   run). Never trust a transcript's claim of success.
6. **Review** — anything `blocked`, `unknown`, or surprising: `agent focus`
   to mark it seen and look, `agent attach` to take over, or prompt it again
   with its context intact (the reason to keep a pane alive).
7. **Retire** — close what you created: `tab close` (which closes its panes
   and kills their processes), or for worktree-backed units `workspace close`
   followed by `task worktree:rm` — the guarded path from § Worktrees.
   `worktree remove --workspace` is only for throwaway trees Herdr itself
   created, since it deletes the checkout unguarded. Never close panes,
   tabs, or workspaces you did not create unless asked; never
   `herdr server stop` from a live session.
8. **Sweep** — the durable leftovers Herdr does not remove: worktrees
   (`worktree list` + `task worktree:rm`), branches (`task clean:branches`
   to review, then `task clean:branches -- --delete` — the bare form is a
   dry run),
   scratch files and sidecars, and anything a worker deliberately detached.
   `herdr notification show` can announce the result.

What is mechanical: closing a tab/pane/workspace terminates everything running
in it (verified — no orphaned agent processes); `worktree remove` removes the
checkout with the workspace. What is on you: steps 5 and 8.

## Multiple harnesses — supported and sanctioned

The orchestration surface is harness-agnostic. `--kind` accepts every agent
the installed Herdr can recognize — run `herdr agent` to see the exact list for
your version; `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `pi`, `omp`, `agy` (Antigravity),
and `opencode` are in the 0.8.2 image the devcontainers pin, newer releases
add more — and
nothing about the loop above changes except the kind and the native arguments
after `--`. A Claude Code orchestrator can
therefore drive Codex, Antigravity, or OpenCode workers — each a separate,
official client running under **its own provider login and subscription**.

That is the permitted shape, and it is worth being precise about why. Each
worker is the vendor's **official CLI**, authenticated as you, driven through
its terminal by a multiplexer that never touches tokens or APIs — the same as
typing into it yourself. What vendors prohibit is using one product's
subscription credentials *inside a different product*: Anthropic's consumer
terms forbid Claude Free/Pro/Max OAuth tokens in any third-party tool or
harness (enforced by token blocking since early 2026); Google and OpenAI keep
similar lines. Running the official `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, or `opencode`
binaries side by side, each on its own plan, is on the right side of every
one of those lines; pointing OpenCode at a Claude subscription is not. The
practical constraint is quota: parallel workers spend each plan's 5-hour and
weekly pools faster, not differently — watch each harness's own usage
indicator, and move genuinely unattended, high-volume work to that vendor's
API billing.

Per-harness notes that shape the launch line:

- **`claude`** — `-- --model <m> --tools '<exact list>' --allowedTools '<the
  same list>'`. The two flags do different halves of least privilege:
  `--tools` restricts which tools *exist* in the session, `--allowedTools`
  pre-approves them so no prompt blocks an unattended worker. `--allowedTools`
  alone is not a restriction — every other tool is still there behind a
  prompt, and the repo's and devcontainer's `settings.json` permissions
  (often broad `Bash(git:*)`/`Bash(gh:*)` allows) merge in. Detection is
  clean; gate variables belong on the pane (`--env`).
- **`codex`** — `-- -a never -s workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`
  for unattended runs, **plus** rules for exactly the commands Codex's policy
  would otherwise prompt on (typically network-touching writes like
  `gh issue edit`) — nothing more. Ordinary build/test commands run inside
  `workspace-write` without any rule, and an `allow` rule executes its
  matches *outside* the sandbox, so blanket-allowing the task's whole command
  set trades the sandbox away. The failure mode to know: with `-a never`,
  any command a rule marks as prompt-worthy is rejected before a shell spawns (`Rejected("approval required by policy, but
  AskForApproval is set to Never")`) with no stderr. Rules match a leading
  prefix of the argv — `["gh"]` matches every `gh` invocation, `["git",
  "status"]` matches `git status …` — so keep `allow` patterns argument-level
  and narrow (an `allow` also runs its matches outside the sandbox), and note
  that a script invoking `gh` internally has the script as `argv[0]` and
  bypasses a bare-command rule entirely. Detection is clean (`osc_title_working`); always confirm
  `working` after a prompt.
- **`agy`, `opencode`, others** — same loop; check detection with
  `agent explain` on first use, and fall back to the file report + sentinel
  where it is `unknown`.

Worker briefs should also say: never set gate or approval variables yourself;
if a script refuses, stop and report. A capable model will otherwise export
the variable to get unstuck.
