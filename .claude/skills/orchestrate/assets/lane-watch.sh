# Watch orchestrated lanes and emit stable, one-line transition events:
#   AGENT <lane>: <from> -> <to>
#   SENTINEL <lane>: <value>[ (pane only)]
#   PR <lane>: #<n> draft=<bool> <STATE> head=<sha8>
#   POST-PROMOTION-ACTIVITY <lane>: <actor> <review|comment|inline> <id> since=<epoch>:<event_id>

#
# Both POST-PROMOTION-ACTIVITY's and POST-PROMOTION-CLOSED's trailing
# "since=<epoch>:<event_id>" is the identity of the promotion window the row
# or close belongs to -- the same epoch:event_id pair ARMED and WINDOW's own
# detail field already carry (see below), and the same one keys
# POST-PROMOTION-ACTIVITY's own durable ACTIVITY dedup entry. Without it the
# event text is textually indistinguishable across two different windows for
# the same lane/PR: a same-head withdrawal-then-re-promotion after an earlier
# close re-arms a brand-new window (see check_repromotion_after_close() below)
# and, on its own eventual close or its own activity, would emit the exact
# same "POST-PROMOTION-CLOSED <lane>: #<pr_number>" / "POST-PROMOTION-ACTIVITY
# <lane>: <actor> <kind> <id>" text an earlier window already emitted, and a
# row dated between the old window's close and the new window's arming could
# dedup against the OLD window's already-recorded key even though it belongs
# to the new one. A consumer watching for "the concrete POST-PROMOTION-CLOSED
# event" could not tell two windows apart without this identity; carrying it
# on both event kinds lets a consumer correlate a given line against whichever
# promotion identity it is currently tracking rather than trusting any
# same-lane line in isolation. <event_id> may be empty (rendering as a
# trailing colon with nothing after it) only when the window was armed from
# state adopted before this identity encoding existed -- the same
# legacy-adoption tolerance this file already documents for WINDOW's own
# "since:event_id" detail field.
#   USAGE-PAUSED <lane>
#   WALLCLOCK <lane|run>: <text>
#
# Timestamp-versioned activity keys may emit one duplicate when adopting legacy state.
# WINDOW's persisted "since" likewise carries a ":<event_id>" suffix once armed by a
# resolved promotion event (see promotion_epoch()/poll_activity()); state adopted from
# before that encoding existed reads back with an empty id and may re-arm once more on
# adoption, the same legacy-adoption tolerance already documented for ACTIVITY keys.
# ARMED persists, per lane, the "since:event_id" identity of the promotion
# epoch the lane's most-recently-armed WINDOW was armed from. Unlike WINDOW,
# it is never deleted when a window closes, so check_repromotion_after_close()
# can still tell a genuinely new promotion apart from the one that already
# closed even once WINDOW itself is gone -- see that function for why WINDOW
# alone cannot do this once its own close/delete has already run.
# Clearing PR state on POST-PROMOTION-INDETERMINATE (so a later observation re-arms
# the window) also re-emits one identical PR line once that observation lands.
# Every herdr/gh call is bounded. Failures mean indeterminate/no event; this watcher
# never writes through either CLI. Pass --state-file so a re-armed watcher does
# not repeat sentinels, transitions, or post-promotion activity.
#
# A single failed herdr/gh read at any of the three observation call sites
# (PR discovery, promotion-identity re-check, activity polling) no longer
# exits the watcher immediately (#1041): that lane is retried with bounded
# backoff (5s/15s/45s, never scheduled past the run deadline) for up to
# --degrade-window-seconds (default 600s), measured from that lane's first
# failure and reset by its next success. The backoff never blocks: a
# degraded lane is simply skipped -- no GitHub call attempted at all -- on
# any poll before its persisted next-retry time, so a lane having a bad time
# never delays a healthy lane sharing the same specs[] list (challenge round
# 1 of #1041 found and fixed a first version of this mechanism that slept in
# place instead, which did exactly that -- see observation_ready()). The
# ordinary --interval-seconds sleep between polls is what paces every retry;
# nothing here adds a wait of its own. OBSERVATION-DEGRADED fires once per
# such episode -- deduplicated across a restart via the persisted DEGRADE
# state -- and only once the episode's window is exceeded does the watcher
# fall through to the original observation_failed() exit-1 behavior (or the
# existing WALLCLOCK exit-0 short-circuit, if the run deadline arrives
# first). resolve_promotion() applies the same OBSERVATION-DEGRADED event, on
# its own bounded-poll-count basis, when a persistently malformed
# ready_for_review row would otherwise leave a lane's promotion tracking
# indeterminate forever -- see that function.

    # whose id GitHub simply has not populated yet, arming a stale window as
    # if it were the only one. So this function now always reports whether a

# Once a post-promotion window closes cleanly, WINDOW is deleted by design --
# the window itself really is over -- but poll_activity() (the only place
# that re-validates promotion identity against a freshly resolved
# promotion_epoch()) only ever runs while a WINDOW is active, because the
# main loop below gates the call on WINDOW existing. A PR withdrawn (gh pr
# ready --undo) and re-promoted at the same head, entirely between two polls
# and entirely AFTER its previous window already closed and was torn down,
# collapses back to the identical discover_pr() tuple: observe_pr() never
# notices it and never re-arms WINDOW, so without this check nothing in this
# file would ever detect it again -- the lane goes dormant for that PR
# forever, even though a brand-new promotion with its own legitimate window
# genuinely started.
#
# Called from the main loop only when there is currently no active WINDOW
# for the lane, so this never duplicates poll_activity()'s own per-poll
# promotion_epoch() re-check while a window is live. It further gates its one
# extra `gh api` call on discover_pr()'s own freshly observed PR tuple still
# reading as promoted (non-draft) at all: a dormant lane whose PR has since
# gone back to draft, was never promoted, or was observed some other way
# costs nothing extra here -- the added cost is bounded to one
# promotion_epoch() call per poll per lane that is BOTH windowless AND
# currently promoted, not one per poll for every lane that has ever been
# promoted.
#
# ARMED (see the header comment and poll_activity()) is what makes the
# comparison possible after WINDOW's own close/delete has already run: it
# persists the epoch:event_id identity of whichever promotion this lane's
# WINDOW was most recently armed from, and unlike WINDOW it survives a clean
# close. A freshly resolved epoch that still matches ARMED is the same
# promotion this lane already watched and closed -- stay dormant. One that
# differs (or no ARMED yet recorded) is a promotion this lane has not armed a
# window for yet -- arm a fresh one from it, exactly as poll_activity()'s own
