# migrate-label-family.sh — rename or transfer a live label family end to
# end, preserving every issue/PR association.
#
# Why a script, not inline shell in a recipe doc: standardize-repo's
# mode-update.md rename recipe earned a P1 finding three review rounds
# running while it stayed prose — a `gh api -f` call that silently flips
# GitHub's default method to POST, a six-value inventory loop with no
# fail-fast on a broken page, and `gh api --paginate --slurp` misread as a
# flat item array when it is actually an array of PAGES (`jq '.[]'` on that
# yields page arrays, not issues — a loop built on it processes nothing and
# a completion check built on it is vacuously "clean"). Every one of those
# is a mechanical mistake a test would have caught immediately. This script
# IS the mechanism; mode-update.md keeps only the why and when.
#
# Usage:
#   migrate-label-family.sh inventory <old-prefix> --repo <owner/repo>
#   migrate-label-family.sh rename <old> <new> --repo <owner/repo> [--execute]
#   migrate-label-family.sh transfer <old> <new> --repo <owner/repo> [--execute]
#   migrate-label-family.sh verify <old-prefix> --repo <owner/repo>
#
# inventory <old-prefix>  Discover every live `<old-prefix>:*` label (case-
#                         insensitive), fetch every issue and PR carrying
#                         each one (paginated, no result-count ceiling), and
#                         report any item carrying MORE THAN ONE of them.
#                         The old family may have resolved such conflicts by
#                         rank; a renamed/merged destination family may not
#                         (see mode-update.md). Refuses (exit 3) while any
#                         conflict remains — resolve each to one label by
#                         hand (`gh issue edit <n> --remove-label
#                         <old-prefix>:<loser>`) before renaming or
#                         transferring anything under this prefix.
#
# rename <old> <new>      Case-insensitive discovery, then an
#                         association-preserving `gh label edit --name`.
#                         Refuses (exit 2) if <new> already exists live —
#                         that is a name collision `gh label edit` would
#                         itself reject, and also the case where <old> and
#                         <new> resolve to the same live label; use
#                         `transfer` instead. Refuses (exit 3, nothing
#                         touched) if any item carrying <old> already
#                         carries a DIFFERENT concrete value of <new>'s own
#                         prefix — after the rename it would carry both,
#                         the same exclusivity conflict `transfer` guards
#                         against. A no-op (exit 0) if <old> is not live:
#                         already renamed, or never existed.
#
# transfer <old> <new>    For the partial state where <new> already exists
#                         (typically because a provisioning task created it
#                         before the rename ran). Resolves <new>'s canonical
#                         live spelling case-insensitively up front and
#                         refuses (exit 2) if it is not live — transfer only
#                         ever moves associations onto an EXISTING label.
#                         Refuses (exit 3, nothing touched) if any item
#                         already carries a DIFFERENT concrete value of
#                         <new>'s own prefix: that value's family is
#                         exclusive with no rank to resolve a second one by
#                         (see mode-update.md), so adding would recreate the
#                         same ambiguity `inventory` exists to catch.
#                         Otherwise adds <new> to every item that carries
#                         <old>, verifies each addition individually (not
#                         just the write call's own exit code — a write can
#                         report success without landing), then re-reads
#                         <old>'s CURRENT membership immediately before
#                         deleting it and refuses (exit 1, nothing deleted)
#                         unless every current member already carries <new>
#                         — catching both an item that joined <old> after
#                         the initial snapshot (never went through the add
#                         loop) and one that lost <new> again since. Only
#                         once every current member verifies does it delete
#                         <old>, which removes it from everything still
#                         attached — deleting before that would lose data
#                         instead of migrating it. Aborts (exit 1) without
#                         deleting on the first failed add or verification.
#
# verify <old-prefix>     Asserts no live label still matches
#                         `<old-prefix>:*`, case-insensitively. Exit 4 if
#                         any remain.
#
# rename/transfer dry-run by default; pass --execute to write (both
# subcommands' destination-resolution and conflict refusals still run in
# dry-run, so a blocker is visible before --execute rather than discovered
# by it). inventory and verify are always read-only.
#
# Every GitHub read goes through --method GET, pinned explicitly — request
# fields (`-f`/`-F`) are never used, because their mere presence flips gh
# api's default method to POST (see ai/skills/universal/shepherd/assets/
# gh-ro.sh, the same guard in this codebase's read-only wrapper). Every read
# is fully paginated with no assumption about how many pages exist, and
# --paginate --slurp output is always flattened with `jq 'add // []'`
# (established elsewhere in this repo, e.g. track-work/assets/
# release-claim.sh) before anything indexes into it as a list of items.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = succeeded, or dry-run / read resolved cleanly
#   1 = a write failed, or transfer's pre-delete recheck found current
#       membership had drifted from what was transferred (either way,
#       nothing was deleted; a failed rename means nothing was renamed)
#   2 = usage/environment error, rename found the destination already live
#       (including <old> and <new> resolving to the same live label), or
#       transfer found the destination not live at all
#   3 = a family-exclusivity conflict: inventory found item(s) carrying more
#       than one <old-prefix> label, or rename/transfer found an item that
#       already carries a different concrete value of <new>'s own prefix
#   4 = verify found live label(s) still matching <old-prefix>
#
# Portable to macOS bash 3.2 (no mapfile, no associative arrays).
