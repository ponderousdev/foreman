# OPERATOR / DEV PROFILE ONLY. This mints a human credential, so it refuses in
# the two contexts where doing that would be wrong:
#
#   1. An env token (GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN and the enterprise variants) is
#      set. That token OVERRIDES the stored one, so `gh auth refresh` would
#      quietly repair a credential the current shell will never use — and in a
#      bot container it is the credential-escalation ADR 0004 exists to
#      prevent. The remedy there is to reissue the token at its source.
#   2. There is no TTY. The refresh is a browser device-code flow; an agent or
#      a CI job cannot complete it, and neither should re-mint the operator's
#      credential unattended.
#
# Read-only until the refresh: it prints the current scopes, then asks gh for
# the missing ones. Token VALUES are never printed or captured.

# 1. Env-token refusal, for the token family gh actually uses on THIS host.
#
#    The four variables are not interchangeable: gh reads GH_TOKEN /
#    GITHUB_TOKEN for github.com (and ghe.com), and GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN /
#    GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN for a GitHub Enterprise Server host. Refusing on
#    any of the four blocked a legitimate dual-host workflow — an exported
#    GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN for a GHES account stopped a github.com refresh that
#    it does not override, and vice versa.
#
#    Where the variable DOES apply, the refusal stands: an env token overrides
#    the stored credential, so `gh auth refresh` would repair something this
#    shell never uses — and in a bot container it is the credential escalation
#    ADR 0004 exists to prevent.
#
#    Resolved before the TTY check because the host is needed either way, and
#    named individually because the fix differs per variable.
