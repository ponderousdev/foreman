# Post-Generation Checklist — Foreman

Work through this after generating the repo from harmon-init. Delete items
that don't apply, then keep this file as a record of what was configured.

Run **`task status:setup`** at any point to audit setup completeness — GitHub
config, toolchain, devcontainer, and dev environment — against the items below
(✓ done · ✗ missing · ? unknown · – n/a).

## 1. Local setup

- [ ] `task install` — Brewfile deps, and lefthook git hooks
- [ ] `task verify` passes locally
- [ ] **Vendor shared agent skills**: `.skills-sync.yaml` pins which harmon-devkit
      skill categories this repo gets (from your `skill_categories` answer). Set
      `ref` to the latest
      [harmon-devkit release](https://github.com/evanharmon1/harmon-devkit/releases)
      that ships the skill category layout, run `task sync:skills`, and commit
      `.claude/skills/`. Until then the `verify:skills*` drift checks skip
      cleanly (CI + pre-push). **Pin bumps are a two-step:** edit `ref` in
      `.skills-sync.yaml`, then run `task sync:skills` and commit the refreshed
      `.claude/skills/` in the same PR — Renovate can bump the ref but can't do
      the re-sync, so a ref-only commit fails the drift check.
- [ ] Verify `foreman.code-workspace` opens the repo's folder in VS Code and has a unique VS Code Workspace color. Then add any other related repos (e.g. other org repos) to the `folders` list in the workspace file so you have quick access to those repos
- [ ] Extend `.gitignore` for your stack — the template ships a base; add stack-specific entries via [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
- [ ] macOS: add a Raycast quicklink/alias that opens the `foreman.code-workspace`
- [ ] macOS (Bunch): scaffold the launcher with `task util:bunch-add` (if not generated at copier time), then `task util:bunch-install` to move it to iCloud and leave a `.meta/*.bunch` symlink (re-run install if missing)

## 2. GitHub repo settings

- [ ] **Automated settings** — run `task setup:github` (idempotent, safe to
      re-run): enables **Dependabot alerts** and **private vulnerability
      reporting**, sets the `FULL_SECURITY_SCAN` variable (CodeQL), and adds
      the `evanharmon1-bot` machine account as a Write
      collaborator. Do NOT add dependabot.yml — Renovate owns version updates.
- [ ] Import the branch ruleset (see [architecture/branch-protection.md](architecture/branch-protection.md)) — do this once `build.yml` is on `main` so the required `verify`/`security` checks resolve. **Use the UI import:** Settings → Rules → Rulesets → **New ruleset ▸ Import a ruleset** → select `.github/Branch Protection Ruleset - Protect Main.json`. (Prefer the UI over `gh api … rulesets`: the API `POST` is not idempotent — re-running creates a duplicate ruleset — and currently rejects the `merge_queue` rule. To later change the ruleset, edit the existing one in the UI rather than re-importing.)

- [ ] Install the [Renovate app](https://github.com/apps/renovate) on the repo
- [ ] Install the [CodeRabbit app](https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai) on the repo (`.coderabbit.yaml` is pre-configured)
- [ ] Actions secret: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (claude-* workflows) — generate
      with `claude setup-token`; the value must start **`sk-ant-oat01-`** (an OAuth
      token, billed to your Claude subscription), **not** `sk-ant-api03-` (a raw API
      key, billed at pay-as-you-go API rates). Then `gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- [ ] Snyk is **optional and local-only**: `task security:sast`/`security:sca` are
      opt-in — they are NOT in CI or `task security`, so run them by hand with
      `SNYK_TOKEN` in your local env / 1Password (no Actions secret needed). If the
      **Snyk GitHub App** is installed it posts `code/snyk`/`security/snyk` PR checks,
      which the branch ruleset does **not** require; remove the app (or this repo from
      it) to drop them.
- [ ] **Create** the CI GitHub App `ponderousdev-ci` by hand (one App per org;
      **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps**), or reuse the org's existing one.
- [ ] **Install** the App on this repo — **Install App → Only select repositories**
      (the harmon-init repos that run release-please / claude-* / project-automation),
      **not "All"**. **Creating the App is not enough:** an App whose credentials are
      set but which is *not installed* on the repo makes
      `actions/create-github-app-token` fail at runtime with a **404**
      (`Not Found` — "not installed on this repository"). This is the single
      easiest step to miss.
- [ ] Set `CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` (Actions **variable**) + `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` (Actions
      **secret**) — **pipe the `.pem` in** (never paste it; flattened newlines break
      the key), and **scope both to those same repos** (least privilege — the key can
      act as the App: commits, PRs, releases, workflow edits):

      ```bash
      gh secret set CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY --org ponderousdev \
        --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> < ponderousdev-ci.private-key.pem
      gh variable set CI_APP_CLIENT_ID --org ponderousdev \
        --visibility selected --repos <repo-a>,<repo-b> --body "<client-id>"  # Iv…-style, not the numeric App ID
      ```

      Personal account: use `--repo ponderousdev/foreman` instead of
      `--org`/`--visibility`/`--repos`. Re-running `--repos` **replaces** the list —
      re-run with the full list to add a repo. Drives release-please, the claude-*
      workflows, and project-automation; blast-radius + rotation in
      docs/architecture/security.md.
- [ ] GHCR: ensure the org/user allows publishing packages; the first
      devcontainer prebuild populates `ghcr.io/ponderousdev/foreman-devcontainer` on merge to main
- [ ] Org issue types: run `task setup:github-issue-types` (needs `gh` with the
      `admin:org` scope) to ensure the org's issue types are Bug/Feature/Task/Research
      (adds any missing; keeps GitHub's defaults) — idempotent and non-destructive.

## 3. Framework scaffolding (conventions-only template)

- [ ] Add the project's primary toolchain; extend Taskfile `build`/`test` accordingly

## 4. Secrets & environment

- [ ] For local `.env` needs, use **1Password Environments** (mounts a virtual
      `.env`; secrets never hit disk or git) or `op run`/`op inject`. Commit only
      `.env.example`-style files
- [ ] Devcontainer secrets: create a **1Password environment** that mounts
      `.devcontainer/devcontainer.env` (and `.devcontainer/dev/devcontainer.env`)
      with `GH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `AGENT_DECK_TELEGRAM_KEY`
      (+ `TS_AUTHKEY` for the dev profile). `init-env.sh` enforces the per-profile
      allow-list; on Coder the values come from workspace parameters. See
      [guides/devcontainers.md](guides/devcontainers.md)

## 5. Docs & meta

- [ ] Fill in the `TODO:` markers in README.md and docs/ (architecture diagram first)
- [ ] Confirm README badges render (Actions URLs are correct once CI runs)
- [ ] Initial release when ready: `task release:init` (v0.1.0) — releases stay manual
- [ ] Stay current with harmon-init: periodically run `copier update --trust` to pull
      template improvements (a three-way merge — your own edits are preserved). The
      standardize-repo skill (`update` mode) automates this and verifies the result.
