# Guides

Calm, repeatable how-tos read *in advance* (the crisis counterpart is
[runbooks/](../runbooks/)).

- [onboarding.md](onboarding.md) — get a new dev or agent productive: setup,
  where things live, the dev loop. The human entry procedure.
- [deploying.md](deploying.md) — how to cut/promote a release (the calm
  procedure); cross-links a rollback runbook for when it goes wrong.
- [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) — symptom → cause → fix for **dev**
  problems (broken build, failing local setup). Distinct from runbooks, which
  cover prod incidents.
- [devcontainers.md](devcontainers.md) — the dual-profile devcontainer (bot vs
  dev), local secrets via **1Password Environments**, GHCR prebuilds, and
  **Coder** setup.
- [devcontainer-performance.md](devcontainer-performance.md) — tuning CPU/RAM
  for the devcontainer; the real levers live in Coder and WSL2, not this repo.
- [foreman-migration.md](foreman-migration.md) — move a consumer off vendored
  `scripts/foreman/` onto the pinned `uvx` dependency (idempotent), plus the
  v1→v2 `.foreman.toml` key migration.

TODO: add more guides, e.g. "local development setup", "add a feature", "how X works".
