# round-push.sh — repository-owned, diff-aware round-push broker for Dev flow
# v2 (specs/dev-flow-v2.md § Configuration "Gates are repository-owned
# Taskfile target slugs" / "Gate authority separates policy from branch
# implementation"; openspec/changes/dev-flow-v2/specs/config/spec.md).
#
# This is the SUCCESSOR to gauntlet/assets/push-round.sh
# for repositories that have migrated `.devflow.toml` to schema_version = 2.
# That older helper is untouched and stays legacy-only (its own gauntlet
# procedure never resolves policy at all); this script instead:
#
#   1. re-derives the merge-base diff class (docs-only vs. code) from the
#      diff itself, never from a caller's assertion;
#   2. resolves `[gates]` and `docs_only_paths` via dev-flow-support's
#      devflow-policy.mjs
#      against a CLOSURE the caller has already materialized outside the
#      feature worktree (git show/git archive <merge-base>:<path>) — this
#      script never resolves a worktree-resident policy, registry, or
#      scanner file itself; every closure-resident input arrives as an
#      explicit path, and every one of those paths is itself verified
#      against the closure's own `git show <closure-base>:<path>` blob
#      before anything reads it, so --closure-base pins content, not just
#      the diff boundary (Codex review, confirmed — see
#      verify_closure_member's own comment);
#   3. EXECUTES the required target for that diff class (round_code or
#      round_docs) itself, from the feature worktree, rather than
#      validating a marker a caller produced — a caller-supplied
#      gate-file/gate-token pair proves nothing was actually run (Codex
#      review, confirmed: the broker's own test helper demonstrated the
#      bypass by fabricating both directly before a successful push); the
#      broker instead emits its own marker as OUTPUT, bound to the gated
#      head and diff class, purely as evidence — never as an input;
#   4. runs the secret scanner itself, unconditionally, via the closure's own
#      gitleaks-scan.sh + .gitleaks.toml (never the worktree's, so a branch
#      cannot weaken the scan that gates its own push);
#   5. then performs the same ref-safety-checked push as the older helper
#      (single writable remote, fast-forward-only, no destination rewrite,
#      no receive-pack override, explicit refspec, no follow-tags), writing
#      to the exact validated push URL rather than re-resolving the mutable
#      named remote at write time.
#
# Bootstrap note (for whatever materializes the closure, not for this script
# itself): a merge base predating this file's own introduction holds only
# the older skill-asset copy of the broker; that caller falls back to
# extracting and running THAT copy, unchanged, for a change structurally
# like this one. A merge base holding neither copy has nothing to extract
# and the round-push gate cannot run at all.
#
# Known, documented limitation (declined, not silently ignored): resolving
# policy during an ACTUAL legacy/v1 -> v2 `.devflow.toml` migration commit
# needs devflow-policy.mjs's `--merge-base-policy` historical-decode path,
# which this script does not thread through — out of scope under the
# maintainer's 2026-09-02 ruling that migration fidelity is low priority
# for this milestone (matching the #666 lane's identical disposition for
# devflow-policy.mjs's own decoder-fidelity gap). This repo has not
# migrated yet, so the gap cannot manifest today.

# Disabled globally, for every git invocation this script makes (not
# threaded through as a per-call flag): `git show <sha>:<path>` — and any
# other read of a commit/tree/blob's content, including the merge-base
# and rev-parse calls this script itself makes — follows a
# `refs/replace/<sha>` ref by default, verified empirically. That ref
# lives under .git/refs/, invisible to the worktree-cleanliness check, so
# a branch-controlled gate installing one would make every
# verify_closure_member/verify_closure_gitleaksignore call (and the
# merge-base computation changed_paths relies on) read tampered content
# while --closure-base's own SHA string never changes (Codex cloud
# review, confirmed). Nothing this script does has a legitimate reason to
# honor a replace ref — its whole job is verifying immutable, true
# closure content — so this is exported once here rather than risking a
# missed call site by threading --no-replace-objects through each one
# individually.

Usage:
  round-push.sh preflight --remote NAME --branch NAME --host HOST --repo OWNER/REPO [-c NAME=VALUE]...

  round-push.sh plan --against REF --closure-base SHA \
    --policy FILE --devflow-policy-script FILE \

preflight is read-only, identical to the older gauntlet helper: it requires
the forge to report push permission and prints the remote branch's current
full object ID, or "absent", for use as the next push's --expect value.

--against REF names the target branch the diff is classified against
(e.g. `origin/main`) — a SYMBOLIC REF, never a bare commit ID or a
revision expression: `git rev-parse --symbolic-full-name --verify` must
resolve it to an actual `refs/*` name. A raw 40/64-hex object ID fails
this (it names no ref at all), and so does `HEAD~1`, `HEAD^`, or any other
`~`/`^`/`@{...}` expression (Codex review round 1, confirmed: rejecting
only hex-shaped values left exactly this class unrejected — a revision
expression is just as capable of naming an arbitrary, too-close commit as
a bare SHA is, and resolves to no symbolic name of its own). plan and push
both derive the merge base themselves via
`git merge-base "$against" "$target"`, resolving --against fresh at
computation time rather than accepting a pre-computed commit ID. This is
a real but partial improvement, stated precisely rather than oversold: it
correctly handles a --against that is not an ancestor of --sha (a
diverged or unrelated ref, which the ancestor-gated design this replaced
could only refuse outright), and it closes off asserting anything with no
binding to an actual named ref. It does NOT and cannot, by itself, prove
the NAMED ref is the semantically correct target — that a caller passes
`--against origin/main` and means it is a trust boundary this script
cannot verify from inside, exactly like the closure files' own provenance
below: the caller (a future integration stage skill) is responsible for
resolving --against from the actual target branch, never from anything
the pushing branch's own content or config could steer.

--closure-base SHA is the exact commit the caller's --policy/--registry/
--gitleaks-config closure was materialized from (the same SHA a
`git show <closure-base>:<path>` extraction used) — a FULL commit ID,
never a ref: the whole point is pinning one exact commit, not whatever a
moving name resolves to right now. plan and push both refuse unless the
merge base freshly computed from --against equals --closure-base exactly
(Codex review round 2, confirmed: --against is resolved fresh at
invocation time, so a ref that moved between closure extraction and this
run — another worktree fetching and advancing origin/main, say — would
otherwise classify the diff against a DIFFERENT commit than the one whose
policy/scanner config the closure actually holds, enforcing stale,
possibly weaker gate policy against a freshly-and-differently-computed
diff boundary; config spec "Gate authority separates policy from branch
implementation": "Merge-base resolution SHALL determine gate policy").

plan re-derives the diff class between the merge base of --against and
--sha (default HEAD) and resolves the required gate target for it, so a
caller knows which `task <target>` to run before minting a gate token. It
touches no marker, scanner, or remote and never pushes.

--registry and one of --task-targets/--taskfile-dir are not bash-enforced
as usage errors, but omitting either leaves devflow-policy.mjs's own
cross-validation indeterminate, which both plan and push treat as a hard
refusal — there is no code path that resolves policy successfully without
them.

preflight/plan/push each refuse any option that belongs only to one of the
other two modes (e.g. --json in push, --gitleaks-config in plan,
--policy in preflight) — a misplaced mode or flag is refused up front
rather than silently ignored.

push additionally requires:
  - --branch to name the worktree's own checked-out branch — never merely a
    syntactically valid one — so a stale or mistyped --branch naming some
    other branch (e.g. main) can't send the checked-out SHA there instead;
  - --policy, --devflow-policy-script, and --registry (when given) to each
    be a regular file (never a symlink — a symlinked entrypoint whose
    TARGET holds the expected bytes would pass a bytewise check while
    Node resolves its own relative imports against the target's real
    directory instead) matching, byte for byte, the blob at their
    canonical repository path in --closure-base (verified via `git show`,
    always run with replace refs disabled — see GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS
    near the top of this file) before any of them is read for any other
    purpose; devflow-policy.mjs's
    own transitive dependency lib/toml-lite.mjs (resolved the same
    way Node resolves it, relative to --devflow-policy-script's own
    directory, and checked against the matching directory at
    --closure-base) is verified the same way, before policy resolution
    ever runs;
  - the required Taskfile target for the recomputed diff class (round_code
    or round_docs) to exit 0 when this script runs it itself, from the
    feature worktree, inheriting this script's own stdout/stderr — there
    is no caller-supplied marker to validate instead; the script prints
    its own `ROUND-GREEN-<sha>-<target>-<class>` line to stdout as
    evidence once this and the scan below both pass, never as something
    it reads back;
  - --gitleaks-script, --gitleaks-config, and gitleaks-scan.sh's own
    transitive dependency scripts/summarize-gitleaks.mjs (resolved
    relative to --gitleaks-script's own directory) to each match
    --closure-base the same way, checked immediately before the scan
    below reads them — after the required target above has already run,
    since that is branch-controlled code with a real chance to tamper
    with closure-resident files living outside the worktree, where
    `git status` cannot see it; the closure's .gitleaksignore (beside
    --gitleaks-config, since there is no --gitleaksignore flag of its
    own) is checked the same way, in both directions — a merge base with
    none must mean the closure has none either;
  - the closure's secret scanner (--gitleaks-script, configured with
    --gitleaks-config) to exit clean against the current worktree;
  - the same ref-safety conditions as the older gauntlet push helper: SHA is
    the full commit ID currently checked out and the tree is clean; the
    named remote has exactly one credential-free push destination matching
    HOST and OWNER/REPO and no custom receive-pack command; the remote
    branch still equals --expect and the update is fast-forward; an explicit
    SHA refspec, lease, and --no-follow-tags update only the named branch;
  - the push destination AND its transport settings (core.sshCommand, any
    inherited GIT_SSH_COMMAND/GIT_SSH, and the HTTP proxy/TLS-verify/
    curloptResolve family — both the bare AND the URL-scoped
    `http.<url>.*` form of each; see transport_fingerprint's own comment)
    to all still match what was validated BEFORE the required target ran,
    checked again immediately before the actual write — git re-applies
    url.*.insteadOf/pushInsteadOf rewriting at push time regardless of
    whether the destination came from a named remote or a literal URL,
    and a branch-controlled gate can install any of these overrides via a
    plain `git config` call that never touches a tracked file, silently
    redirecting or weakening the connection regardless of the validated
    hostname; either check can only shrink the window a change could land
    in, never make git's own resolution atomic;
  - the diff this classifies to be computed with --no-relative and
    --ignore-submodules=none, regardless of ambient diff.relative/
    diff.ignoreSubmodules config — diff.relative=true silently OMITS every
    changed path outside the invocation directory rather than merely
    reformatting them (verified empirically), so a code change elsewhere
    in the tree could otherwise be invisible to classification, authorizing
    the weaker round_docs gate for a diff that actually contains code.

Each accepted -c NAME=VALUE is passed to destination resolution, ls-remote,
and push, so an unprovisioned host can supply the repository's documented
HTTPS transport overrides without bypassing the named remote. The allowlist
is deliberately narrow: credential.helper, url.*.insteadOf, and
protocol.*.allow. Config that can redirect a push (including
url.*.pushInsteadOf) is refused. VALUE may be empty, as required to reset
Git's credential-helper chain.

# Prints the set of paths that changed between the TRUE merge base of

# the current working directory to be a real checkout of the feature
# branch: the closure has no git history to diff, only extracted files.
#
# The merge base is derived here, never accepted as a caller-supplied
# value: Codex challenge round 2, confirmed — an earlier revision took an
# explicit --merge-base SHA and only checked it was SOME ancestor of the
# target, which a caller (or a bug) could satisfy with any earlier
# ancestor, narrowing or emptying the diff and letting a code change
# classify as docs-only. `git merge-base "$against" "$target"` computes the
# one true common ancestor deterministically, leaving no value for a
# caller to substitute. --against stays a named ref (e.g. `origin/main`)
# even when the caller resolved it to a SHA before extracting the
# closure — require_against_is_ref below refuses a bare commit ID here on
# purpose; that resolved SHA is what --closure-base carries instead, so
# the two flags together still pin the exact commit the closure came from
# without letting --against itself be a disconnected object ID.
#
# --no-renames is required, not cosmetic: with rename detection on (git's
# own default), a 100%-similar rename reports ONLY the destination path —
# renaming code/foo.sh to docs/foo.md would then classify as docs-only
# with the source path outside docs_only_paths entirely invisible to the
# classifier below, accepting the weaker round_docs gate for what is still
# code content. --no-renames reports a rename as a delete of the old path
# plus an add of the new one, so both sides are checked against
