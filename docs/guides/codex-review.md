# Codex second-model review

A second AI model — the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)
— reviews changes in this repo: manual review/challenge tasks, plus an optional
automatic Claude Code → Codex stop-gate. Those tasks are local and advisory:
nothing runs in CI, no PR check depends on Codex, and `verify`/`ci` never invoke
it. Repositories can separately opt into a required current-head result from
Codex cloud review during PR shepherding. Findings are hypotheses for the
primary agent to adjudicate — the protocol and the loop caps live in AGENTS.md
("Second-Model Review").

## Setup

1. **Install the Codex CLI**: `brew install --cask codex` (macOS) or
   `npm install -g @openai/codex` (anywhere Node ≥ 18 runs).
2. **Authenticate**: `codex login` (browser OAuth against a ChatGPT account —
   the free tier has tight usage limits) or
   `printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key` (billed API usage).
   Confirm with `codex login status`.
3. **Trust the repo in Codex** when prompted on first run. The committed
   `.codex/config.toml` raises the project-instruction budget to 64 KiB. Review
   tasks explicitly select `gpt-5.6-sol` with high reasoning, independently of
   the interactive default.
4. **For the automatic stop-gate only — the Claude Code codex plugin.** This
   repo's `.claude/settings.json` declares the `openai-codex` marketplace and
   enables `codex@openai-codex`, so Claude Code installs/offers the plugin
   when you trust the folder. Manual install, inside Claude Code:

   ```text
   /plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
   /plugin install codex@openai-codex
   /codex:setup
   ```

5. **If `use_codex_cloud_review` is enabled, connect this repository to Codex
   cloud review for PR shepherding.** The Copier opt-in adds the policy but
   cannot grant GitHub access: a maintainer must connect Codex through ChatGPT
   and allow the repository in the GitHub connector. Availability and quotas
   depend on the maintainer's ChatGPT plan, and private repositories require
   explicit connector access. Cloud review is a required shepherd signal, not
   a required GitHub status check; if it stays unavailable for both bounded
   attempts, the agent stops and escalates. Where Foreman is also enabled,
   `.foreman.toml`'s `[reviewer]` table holds the same contract for
   foreman-shepherded PRs: foreman posts the configured `@codex review`
   request itself and promotes a draft only on a current-head result from the
   configured login — fail-closed, with bounded attempts.

6. **Then disable Codex Automatic reviews** — personal Auto review off, the
   repository's Auto code review preference set to **Follow personal**, and its
   review **Trigger** set to Follow personal too (an "On every push" trigger
   sits dormant while Auto review is off and arms the moment the personal
   toggle changes). Codex triggers a cloud review on three events: opening a
   PR for review, marking a draft ready, and an explicit `@codex review`. Only
   the third is usable here: the PR is a draft for the whole automated
   lifecycle, so the first never fires, and the second fires *after* the
   readiness gate — starting a new asynchronous review at the exact moment
   "non-draft" is supposed to mean the automated work is done. Record the
   three knobs under docs/CHECKLIST.md's [human-only] item; once recorded it
   is settled configuration — nothing in the lifecycle gates on it, and the
   one thing worth reporting later is an unsolicited Codex review, the
   signature of the knobs drifting back on.

## Manual reviews

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `task challenge` (= `challenge:codex`) | Adversarial review — tries to break the change: architecture, authz bypasses, data-loss paths, unsafe rollback, races, hidden coupling, operational failure modes, needless complexity |
| `task review` (= `review:codex`) | Verification checkpoint — double-checks implementation, consistency with repo conventions, error handling, and test coverage |

Both accept an explicit target and free-text focus after `--`:

```bash
task challenge                                     # auto: commits beyond the base AND uncommitted work — whatever exists
task challenge -- --base main                      # committed history only, vs main explicitly
task review -- --uncommitted                       # staged + unstaged + untracked only
task challenge -- --base main focus on the update/migration path
```

With no target flag, **both halves of the change are in scope**: the commits
beyond the auto-detected base (`origin/HEAD`, else a local `main`/`master`)
*and* the working tree. When both exist the prompt carries one manifest split
into a `Committed changes` and an `Uncommitted changes` section, so the
reviewer knows which diff to collect for each path; when only one exists it is
reviewed on its own. If the base cannot be resolved at all, the run refuses
(exit 2) rather than falling back to the worktree half — a partial review that
exits 0 is indistinguishable from a clean pass. The explicit flags stay narrow
deliberately — `--base` is committed history only and `--uncommitted` is the
worktree only — so they remain escapes you opt into rather than a default that
quietly drops half the change.

Whichever target you pick, an empty one is refused before Codex is invoked,
with a non-zero exit. An empty scope has no correct outcome — the model either
invents one or declines, and a decline reads exactly like a clean pass, so a
capped challenge/review round would be spent banking a review that never
happened. `--base` on a dirty tree also says so on stderr: it reviews
committed history only, and the uncommitted work it excludes is often the very
change you meant to review.

`--base` also warns when the ref you named lags its own upstream and your
branch already carries some of the difference — `--base main` on a checkout
whose local `main` trails `origin/main` puts those already-merged commits
inside `main...HEAD`, so the review spends a round on findings against files
your branch never touched. The warning counts the already-merged commits caught
in the scope and names the remote-qualified alternative (`--base origin/main`),
and it is advisory: an intentionally older base still runs. Partly-updated
branches count too — rebasing onto a mid-point of the gap still leaves those
commits in scope. It stays quiet when the base has no upstream (a tag, a sha,
`origin/main` itself), when your branch carries none of the upstream commits,
when the base has run *ahead* of its upstream rather than behind, and when the
gap changes no files at all (a change and its revert) — the two scopes are
byte-identical there, so there is nothing to warn about.

Inside Claude Code the plugin's slash commands are the interactive
equivalents: `/codex:review` and
`/codex:adversarial-review --base main --background` (with extra focus text
allowed after the flags), plus `/codex:status` / `/codex:result` for
background runs.

### Duration and backgrounding

A round is **minutes, not seconds** — 5–15 is ordinary and passing ten is not
unusual. The cost tracks how much the reviewer *reads*, not how large the diff
is: it re-reads AGENTS.md, this guide, and whatever those point at on every
round, so a three-line docs change can run as long as a feature branch.

That is longer than a typical agent's tool-call timeout (Claude Code's Bash
tool caps at 600s), so an agent must **start these tasks in the background and
poll** rather than blocking one call on them — otherwise an ordinary round
surfaces as a timeout and reads like a hang. Use the harness's own background
execution (in Claude Code, the Bash tool's background option): it owns the
process, reports completion, and can cancel the run and its children. Where a
harness has no such primitive, run the task in a terminal you can watch —
do not hand-roll a supervisor around it in the shell, which trades a ten-minute
wait for orphaned processes, races over shared log files, and a completion
signal that the reviewed diff can spoof.

Two things not to change when backgrounding:

- **The target.** Bare `task challenge` keeps the auto-selection above — the
  branch's commits and the working tree, whichever exist. At this point in the
  loop the tree is normally dirty *and* the branch has commits, so a hardcoded
  `-- --base main` would review the committed branch and silently skip the
  very work being challenged (and name the wrong base in a repo that does not
  use `main`). Add a target flag only when you mean to narrow. Note
  `origin/HEAD` is a *cached* ref: if the remote's default branch moved,
  refresh it with `git remote set-head origin --auto`, or the auto-selected
  base is silently the old one.

  The explicit scopes do not overlap: `--uncommitted` reads the worktree,
  `--base` diffs commits, and **neither covers both**. That is why passing one
  mid-loop is risky — an uncommitted fix under `--uncommitted` narrows the
  re-run to just that fix, and the clean pass then attests to the fix rather
  than to the whole change. Bare `task challenge` covers both halves, so it is
  the right thing to re-run — and it is why commit boundaries never change what
  a round sees.

  Commit anyway, and push: each adjudicated round ends in one conventional
  commit pushed to the branch, which the Dev Loop makes the rule rather than a
  tidiness preference. It also keeps the committed half authoritative and
  shrinks what Codex has to reconcile. What it does not do is decide the exit
  condition — that is still the adjudicated rounds, whatever the tree looked
  like when each one ran.
- **The runner.** Background `task challenge` itself, not
  `/codex:adversarial-review --background`: the slash command calls Codex
  directly, so it never receives the P0/P1/P2/P3 scale that
  `scripts/codex-review.sh` writes into the prompt. Fine for an interactive
  spot-check; it cannot establish the adjudicated-clean rounds this loop gates
  on.

**Then leave the tree alone until it finishes.** `codex-review.sh` captures the
file manifest at launch, but Codex collects the diffs itself as it runs — so
editing, staging, or committing mid-review has it read a repository that no
longer matches the manifest, and committing an initially dirty tree empties an
explicit `--uncommitted` scope outright. Backgrounding buys polling, not
parallel edits: if there is other work to do, do it after the verdict. Should
you capture the output to a file, keep it under `git rev-parse --git-path`
rather than in the worktree — for the same reason the deferred-findings
sidecar lives there, a stray worktree file lands in the next bare
`task challenge`'s scope as part of the change under review.

**Still running is not hung.** `codex exec` streams events as it works, so
growing output is the liveness signal — poll it instead of inferring. Long
gaps between events are normal, and relaunching never resumes a run, it starts
a fresh one, so re-running a live review doubles both the wall clock and the
Codex usage the first one already spent. Bound the patience rather than the
run: if the output has been static for **~20 minutes** — well past any normal
gap — treat it as wedged on a stalled API call rather than thinking, cancel it
through the harness that started it, and only then start over.

## The automatic stop-gate

```bash
task codex:gate:enable    # turn on for this repo on this machine
task codex:gate:disable   # turn off
task codex:gate:status    # inspect
```

Disarming the gate is a human-only action, enforced in layers: the toggles
sit in `permissions.ask` in `.claude/settings.json`, and `disable`
additionally refuses to run without an interactive terminal — permission
prefix rules alone can be sidestepped with flag placement (e.g.
`task --silent codex:gate:disable`), but agent shells never have a TTY. A
gated agent must never disable the gate to get past a BLOCK — adjudicate or
escalate instead. (This is friction against silent disarmament, not an
absolute boundary: the plugin's own `/codex:setup --disable-review-gate` is
outside this repo's control, which is why the AGENTS.md prohibition exists.)
`enable` also refuses when the plugin is explicitly disabled in Claude Code
settings (`enabledPlugins`): an installed-but-disabled plugin registers no
Stop hook, so the armed flag would report protection that does not exist.

Mechanics: the codex plugin registers a Claude Code **Stop hook**. While the
gate is enabled for a workspace, every time Claude finishes a turn the hook
runs a fresh, read-only Codex task over the repo and Claude's last message;
Codex answers `ALLOW:` or `BLOCK: <reason>`. A block feeds the reason back
into Claude, which must address it (or refute it — see the adjudication
protocol) before it can finish. Non-editing turns are allowed through.

The tasks flip the same per-workspace `stopReviewGate` flag as
`/codex:setup --enable-review-gate` (plugin data dir keyed by workspace path
— note a git worktree is a different workspace with its own flag; the state
is per-user and per-machine, never committed). Fail-open is **narrower than
it looks**: only a missing codex binary makes the hook log guidance and let
Claude stop. An installed-but-unauthenticated codex makes the review task
fail, which the hook converts into a **block on every turn** — so
`task codex:gate:enable` refuses to arm the gate unless `codex login status`
succeeds, and if auth expires while the gate is on, recover with
`codex login` or `task codex:gate:disable` (disable/status never require
auth; disable does require an interactive terminal).

Loop safety: Claude Code caps consecutive stop-hook continuations, and repo
policy caps the adversarial/review loops (AGENTS.md "Dev Loop"). The
gate reviews after **every** turn while enabled and each run costs Codex
usage — enable it for high-consequence work (migrations, auth, concurrency,
release plumbing), disable it for routine development.

## Intended workflow

```text
task check      # fast inner loop while editing
task verify     # definition-of-done gate
task challenge  # adversarial second model — adjudicate, fix, re-challenge
                # until TWO CONSECUTIVE rounds adjudicate to zero P0/P1
                # (a round with no findings ends it once the level's
                # min_rounds floor is met), under the challenge cap
                # resolved from .devflow.toml
task review     # verification checkpoint — same convergence rule, under its
                # own resolved review cap
task ci         # full CI mirror
# → open a DRAFT PR, then shepherd it: watch CI + reviews, settle the deferred
#   P2s, adjudicate → fix → push, under the shepherd cap (independent of the
#   loops above)
# → readiness gate passes → gh pr ready (the handoff to a human)
# → merging stays a human decision
```

The full staged loop — including the PR-shepherding rounds and the readiness
gate that ends them — is defined in AGENTS.md ("Dev Loop"). The PR is a
**draft** for every stage above: it is the agent's workbench, and promoting it
is the one signal that the automated work is finished.

The caps are not written down here, or in AGENTS.md. They live in
[`.devflow.toml`](../../.devflow.toml) as `rigor` levels, and **AGENTS.md alone
defines how a change resolves one** — restating that chain here would only give
it a second place to drift from, and which inputs are even available depends on
how the repository is set up. `challenge`, `review`, and the `min_rounds` floor vary by level; the
shepherd cap is fixed, because it bounds other people's findings rather than
self-generated work. Announce the resolved caps — the floor included — when
you enter the loop.

If Codex cloud review is connected to the repo, PRs
get a cloud pass too: inline comments only for high-priority findings, a
👍 from the pinned Codex bot actor ID `199175422` on the exact
`@codex review` trigger comment as the clean pass. That reaction must post
after both the current head was pushed and its review request was created.
Those requests are explicit and made while the PR is draft — which is why
Automatic reviews must be off (setup step 6): an automatic review triggered by
`gh pr ready` would land after the gate that promoted the PR.

## Convergence: when a stage ends

A stage — `challenge` and `review`, counted separately — ends when
**two consecutive rounds adjudicate to zero P0 and zero P1 findings**. Those
rounds may come back empty, all-P2 as labeled, or P1-labeled and adjudicated
down to
P2; what counts is the **adjudicated** column of your adjudication table, not
the label Codex attached. The second such round *is* the confirmation, so no
extra run is owed after it. Two cases exit faster still. A round with **no
findings at all** ends the stage on the spot **once the level's `min_rounds`
floor is met** (1 wherever a level does not set it) — an empty round is exactly
the older "clean re-run" exit, so neither a trivial change nor a clean
post-fix re-run pays for a confirmation pass, and a floor of 2 only delays
that shortcut, never the other two exits, which run at least two rounds by
construction. And a **capped
final round** that adjudicates to zero P0/P1 ends the stage by itself: the
confirmation it would otherwise owe is a run the cap forbids, and escalation
at the cap is reserved for P0/P1 findings that persist — a clean last round
is convergence, not disagreement.

The old rule charged for three things it never delivered. A confirmation run
after an all-P2 round: `harmon-init#725` ran roughly ten gate iterations for a
six-line documentation fix, most of them re-attesting a change nobody disputed.
Label inflation: a reviewer-labeled P1 that adjudication settled as a P2 still
bought a fix-and-re-run cycle, which is how `harmon-init#664`/`#666` spent
their late rounds — at 30–45 minutes apiece. And scaffolding drift: each round
of hardening added surface for the next round to attack, and every finding
along the way was individually defensible.

The **scaffolding damper** is what replaces the cap as the first line of
defense. At round 2 — the earliest round that can show the pattern — say on
the table, for each finding, whether its subject exists only because an earlier
round of the same stage added it. Where it does, adjudicate it with one of
three dispositions written down: delete the scaffolding, restructure it to
invariants, or state that the code is in scope and why the change needs it.

**Restructuring to invariants** is deletion by abstraction, and it is the
disposition to reach for when plain deletion is unavailable. Some artifacts —
specs, policy documents, AGENTS.md itself — accrete procedure-prose that
earlier rounds legitimately demanded, so it cannot just be dropped without
dropping the obligation with it. Instead, replace the attackable procedure with
the universally-quantified property it was approximating, delegate the
mechanism to the implementation surface that can actually be tested, and carry
the round's attack scenarios across as required test cases. The wording seam
the next round would have attacked is gone, and the obligation survives as a
property plus its tests rather than as prose. Three rounds of trust-rule
whack-a-mole in the 2026-08-13/14 spec session ended in exactly one such
restructure. It shares deletion's accounting: it does not re-score the round
that raised the findings, and it must be named on the table and in the commit
message, because "the procedure is gone" and "the requirement is gone" look
identical in a diff and are not the same thing.

A deletion does not re-score the round
that flagged the code — the finding keeps its adjudicated priority there, and
it is the **next** round, reviewing the tree without it, that finds nothing
left to re-raise and counts toward convergence. Reflexively hardening the
previous round's fix is the failure mode; naming it on the table is the
check.

Two things do not move. The **per-stage cap** stands — whatever rigor level
resolved it — and persistent
P0/P1 disagreement at the cap is escalated rather than iterated on. And the
deferred-P2 chain is a **precondition** of the exit, not a casualty of it:
every P2 open at convergence must already be in the sidecar below, so
`gh pr create` can move it into the PR body and the shepherd can settle it. An
exit that drops a P2 is not an exit.

## Finding priorities

Both modes ask Codex to label every finding on this scale. The label is the
reviewer's opening claim; what the local loops gate on is the **adjudicated**
priority — your verdict after verifying the finding (see "Convergence: when a
stage ends" above). Adjudication may downgrade a label with evidence, never
silently drop one:

| Priority | Meaning | Gates `challenge`/`review`? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P0` | Breaks correctness, security, or data integrity in ordinary use, or breaks an existing contract | Yes |
| `P1` | A real defect or materially wrong design decision with a plausible trigger | Yes |
| `P2` | Worth knowing, not merge-blocking: hardening, unlikely edge cases, maintainability, non-critical test gaps | No |
| `P3` | Cosmetic or purely informational: a naming or wording choice that will mislead a reader, an observation with no defect behind it. The no-style-nits rule still binds — P3 is the floor for findings worth stating, not a licence to report nits | No |

The scale lives in the prompt that `scripts/codex-review.sh` builds — not in
the Codex CLI's own priority labels, which are an undocumented convention
that can change. Keeping the definition local means the gate still means what
it says when Codex's output format moves.

That prompt reaches the **local** tasks only. Codex **cloud** review runs on
its own instructions and has been seen badging a finding off this scale (a
real `P3` on `harmon-init#918`, before P3 was defined here). So the scale
closes with a property rather than a list.

**A label is a hypothesis; the adjudicated severity is the verdict.** This
holds for every finding from every reviewer, and P3 is not an exception to it:

- The severity that counts is the one **you** adjudicate on evidence, never
  the one the reviewer wrote. That is already how P0 and P1 are handled; the
  scale just makes it explicit at the bottom too.
- **Adjudication alone decides deferral.** The sidecar records what is
  *deferred*, so an entry is owed only for a finding that is both unresolved
  and carried forward: one fixed in place leaves nothing to defer, and one
  adjudicated genuinely cosmetic leaves nothing to carry. What the badge may
  never do is skip the adjudication that decides which of those it is — the
  `P3` on harmon-init#918 was a real parsing defect, so this is an observed
  failure mode, not a hypothetical one.
- A badge **off** the scale, or absent entirely, starts at **at least a P2**.
  A future `P4` is triaged, never dropped for being unrecognized.

Nothing in that depends on which reviewer produced the badge, so no
provenance rule is needed: an under-labelled finding is caught by adjudicating
it, wherever it came from.

**The mechanism belongs to the shepherd stage, not to this prose.** How a
cloud finding is answered depends on the surface it landed on, and `AGENTS.md`
is the authority — it carries both procedures, because a repository can answer
`use_codex_review` yes and `use_skills_sync` no, which renders this guide with
no vendored checker at all. Follow whichever of the two applies to your
checkout; nothing below overrides it.

**Where the pinned checker is vendored**
(`.claude/skills/shepherd/assets/check-codex-cloud-review.sh`), its exit codes
are the contract. Two things about it are worth knowing because they are not
symmetric:

- An **inline** finding is classified independently of its badge and is
  answered by a trusted in-thread reply, so an inline cloud P3 is on the
  ordinary reply path with everything else.
- A badged finding stated **outside** an inline thread has no reply linkage,
  and `settle` currently refuses a badge it does not recognize as `p[0-2]`.
  So an unfixed, non-inline cloud P3 has no way to be recorded as settled
  *by that checker*: fix it and push (which starts a fresh-head cycle and
  resolves it), or if it genuinely needs no change, report the blocker and
  leave the PR draft. That gap is being fixed upstream in
  evanharmon1/harmon-devkit#530 and re-pinned here; it is a limitation of the
  current pin, not a rule.

**Where it is not vendored**, that limitation does not exist to work around:
`AGENTS.md`'s checker-absent procedure governs, and a non-inline finding is
answered and its disposition recorded on the pull request in the ordinary way.
Do not import the paragraph above into that configuration — leaving a PR draft
indefinitely over a `settle` call your checkout has no way to make would be
the wrong reading.

P2s are **reported, adjudicated, and deferred**, never suppressed: they carry
to the PR-shepherd stage, where they are fixed, declined with reasoning, or
filed as follow-up issues. That keeps the expensive local loops focused on
what actually blocks a merge, without losing the smaller findings.

The deferral needs somewhere to land. These tasks run **locally** — their
output lives in a terminal and nowhere else — and the cloud reviewer reposts
only high-priority findings, so a deferred P2 that is not written down is
gone. Write each one into the **PR description** under a
`## Deferred findings` heading, as an unchecked task-list item:

```markdown
## Deferred findings

- [ ] scripts/foo.sh:42 — P2: retry loop has no upper bound
```

Both tasks run before `gh pr create`, so write each finding down the moment
you defer it, in the git directory rather than the worktree:

```bash
note="$(git rev-parse --git-path \
  "deferred-findings/$(git branch --show-current)")"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$note")"
cat >>"$note" <<'DEFERRED'
- [ ] scripts/foo.sh:42 — P2: retry loop has no upper bound
DEFERRED
```

One file **per branch**: an ordinary clone switches branches in place, so a
single shared sidecar would let branch B's PR absorb branch A's findings — and
then delete A's only copy when it clears the file. The branch name is used as
a path rather than flattened, so `feat/x` and `feat-x` stay distinct — and
without an extension, so `foo` cannot block `foo.md/bar`. That makes the
sidecar tree mirror git's ref namespace, which already forbids one live
branch from being a path prefix of another.

The **quoted** heredoc delimiter is load-bearing: findings routinely quote
code with backticks or `$(…)`, and inside a double-quoted string the shell
would run it. Quoting disables expansion, not termination — so pick a
delimiter the finding text cannot contain.

Check the file before appending: an unchanged P2 is unchanged code, so it comes
back every remaining round and again in the next stage — deferring it does not
silence it. Add it once, matching on location and substance rather than exact
wording.

Move the list into the PR description when you open the PR, then delete the
file — and sweep the tree for strays while you are there:

```bash
ls -R "$(git rev-parse --git-path deferred-findings)"
```

Renaming or deleting a branch strands its notes under the old name, where
nothing looks for them again. Account for every file the sweep shows: adopt an
orphan if it belongs to this work, otherwise leave it and mention it. One
command beats rename-migration logic that would need its own correctness
argument. The location is deterministic, so a later session finds it the same
way, and `git status` never sees it — a note left in the *worktree* would be
worse than none, because a dirty tree puts it in the next bare
`task challenge`'s scope: a file of open findings, handed to the reviewer as
part of the change to adjudicate.

The shepherd stage settles every entry and ticks it off in the body as it
goes, so the checkbox — not anyone's memory — is what says whether a finding
is still open. The PR is not green while an unchecked entry remains.
AGENTS.md ("Dev Loop") carries that obligation, so it holds even where the
optional `/shepherd` skill that automates it is not installed.

Note that the automatic stop-gate is not on this scale — the plugin's Stop
hook uses its own notion of a material finding and may BLOCK on a P2.
Adjudicate it; never disable the gate to get past a BLOCK.

## Troubleshooting

- **`codex` not found** — install per Setup; on Linux/devcontainers use the
  npm install (the Homebrew `codex` cask is macOS-only).
- **Auth expired** — `codex login status`, then `codex login` (or
  `codex login --device-auth` without a browser).
- **`/codex:*` commands missing in Claude Code** — trust the folder so the
  repo-declared plugin installs, or install manually (Setup step 4), then
  restart Claude Code.
- **Gate toggle "plugin not installed"** — the `codex:gate:*` tasks drive the
  plugin's own runtime under `~/.claude/plugins`; install the plugin first
  (Setup step 4).
- **Gate enabled but nothing happens** — `task codex:gate:status`; remember
  the flag is per workspace path (worktrees toggle separately) and fails open
  when Codex is unavailable.
- **Nothing to review** — the resolved target is empty, so the run refuses
  (exit 1) instead of asking Codex to review nothing; the message names the
  condition and the way out. Reaching it from `task challenge` with no flags
  means a clean tree with no commits beyond the base. Reaching it from
  `--base <ref>` usually means the work is still uncommitted — drop the flag
  to review both halves, or use `--uncommitted`.
- **Could not resolve a base to review this branch against** — no
  `origin/HEAD` and no local `main`/`master`, or the detected base shares no
  history with `HEAD` (exit 2). It refuses on a dirty tree too, rather than
  quietly reviewing the worktree alone: which commits are missing is exactly
  what cannot be determined, and a partial review that exits 0 reads as a
  clean pass. Fix the cached ref (`git remote set-head origin --auto`), name a
  base with `--base <ref>`, or say the worktree really is the whole target
  with `--uncommitted`.
- **A captured log is enormous, and the verdict is buried** — the CLI logs
  some errors with the entire API response inlined, so one line can run to
  hundreds of kilobytes and a retry loop repeats it. `codex-review.sh` bounds
  each **stderr** line to `CODEX_REVIEW_MAX_STDERR_BYTES` (default 1024) and
  marks what it cut; stdout, where the verdict is, is never filtered. Set the
  variable to `0` to capture a payload in full when debugging the CLI itself.
  A recurring dump usually means the CLI is older than the API it is talking
