# consumer-pin-audit.sh — check that a repository's vendored-skill pin and its
# `.devflow.toml` policy shape agree.
#
# Dev flow v2's stage skills operate under `schema_version = 2` and carry no
# interpreter for the pre-v1 legacy shape or the v1 shape (harmon-devkit#604).
# Skills sync and the harmon-init `copier update` run on independent cadences,
# so the two halves migrate at different times, and both orders of skew are
# real:
#
#   * v2 skills over a not-yet-migrated policy — the skills refuse every run.
#     The fix is `copier update`, not a code change; until it lands the
#     repository holds its pin at the last pre-v2 skills release.
#   * a migrated policy under pre-v2 skills — the repository is running the
#     retired single-stage procedure against a config that no longer describes
#     it. The fix is to advance the pin and re-sync.
#
# This audit names which of those a repository is in, so the pin is advanced
# deliberately rather than discovered by a broken run.
#
# What "the vendored skills require" is read from the skills themselves, not
# from a version table this script would have to keep current: every stage
# skill that resolves policy ships `assets/policy-contract.json` declaring its
# `policy_schema_version`. The requirement is the SINGLE version every managed
# contract agrees on — a schema version names an incompatible shape, not a
# minimum capability level, so a managed set declaring two different versions
# is refused as indeterminate rather than resolved to either one. A pre-v2
# skill ships no such file and therefore requires nothing, which is exactly
# right for an unadvanced pin.
#
# Usage:
#   consumer-pin-audit.sh [--repo-root DIR] [--manifest FILE] [--policy FILE]
#                         [--reader FILE] [--json]
#
# Defaults: --repo-root `.`, --manifest <root>/.skills-sync.yaml,
# --policy <root>/.devflow.toml, --reader this repository's
# ai/skills/universal/dev-flow-support/assets/devflow-policy.mjs (the shape oracle; the audit never parses TOML
# itself, so there is one implementation of shape detection).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  compatible — the vendored skills' policy requirement and the
#      repository's policy shape agree (including "neither has migrated"), or
#      the vendored set contains no policy-consuming skill at all
#      (`no-policy-consumer`), so there is no pin contract to satisfy.
#   1  incompatible — the vendored skills require a policy shape the
#      repository's does not have. When the required version is within the
#      toolchain's supported range, migrate with `copier update`; when it
#      exceeds it, upgrade the policy tooling. Do NOT advance the pin.
#   2  usage error, or the audit is indeterminate (no manifest, unreadable
#      policy, missing reader). Never reported as a pass.
#   3  pin lag — the policy has migrated but the vendored skills predate it.
#      Advance `source.ref` in the manifest and re-run `task sync:skills`.

#
# Evidence, re-checkable with these two commands:

# ai/skills/universal/orchestrate/assets/test-consumer-pin-audit.sh asserts the boundary behaviour relative

#
# Review round 4, confirmed by reproduction and by git: the previous form was
# a list of the v2 skill names, so a consumer pinned at v0.39.0 — whose stages
# are `gauntlet` and `shepherd` — reported `no-policy-consumer` exit 0
# ("nothing here needs to change") over a freshly migrated policy, when the
# correct answer is pin lag. The regression test masked it by constructing
# pre-v2 fixtures under v2 names that never existed at any pre-v2 tag.

#
#   An input the shared reader refuses, or a stamp inconsistent with the tree,
#   is INDETERMINATE: exit 2, never `compatible`.
#
# This is one rule, not a list of special cases. The audit compares a pin
# against a policy, and that comparison is only meaningful on inputs that are
# internally coherent; anything else has no pin verdict to give, and guessing
# one is precisely the fail-open this script exists to prevent.
#
# It is stated here and enforced through `indeterminate` below because the
# case-by-case alternative demonstrably regresses: `mixed` was closed while
# `unknown` stayed open, a missing managed directory was closed while a
# missing `SKILL.md` payload stayed open, each fix drawing the next round's
# finding. `ai/skills/universal/orchestrate/assets/test-consumer-pin-audit.sh` tests it as a PROPERTY over
# every incoherent input rather than as one assertion per case, so a newly
# discovered incoherent input is a new row in that table, not a new branch here.
#
# Two classes are covered:
#
#   * the POLICY is not exactly one shape the reader recognizes — `mixed` or
#     `unknown` (an incomplete marker set), which
#     `openspec/changes/dev-flow-v2/specs/config/spec.md` requires be rejected
#     "not guessed into either shape". `legacy` and `v1` are NOT incoherent:
#     they are coherent older shapes, and reporting on them is the audit's
#     whole job.
#   * the VENDORED STATE disagrees with itself — a provenance stamp missing
#     its `# ref:`/`# managed:` lines, a managed name with no directory or no
#     `SKILL.md` payload, vendored contract-carrying skills with no stamp at
#     all (an interrupted sync), a contract whose version is not a positive
#     integer, or managed contracts that do not agree on one version.

    # residue, and that check was never decidable. With no stamp,
    # `sync-skills.sh`'s own rule is that nothing is managed, so a
    # contract-free directory is indistinguishable from a local skill —
    # harmon-devkit's own `.claude/skills` holds six real, tracked
    # `openspec-*` directories that are exactly that. Deleting the undecidable
    # check removes the need for any exemption, and with no exemption there is
    # nothing left to leak.

    # What is lost is detection of an interrupted PRE-v2 sync (contract-free
    # `gauntlet`/`shepherd` residue). That was never decidable here either, and
