# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Codex,
...) working in Foreman. `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` are symlinks to this file — edit only
`AGENTS.md`.

TODO: Run `/init` (Claude Code) after the framework is scaffolded to expand
this file with project-specific architecture notes.

## Project Overview

Deterministic supervisor for dispatching agent work across local, Docker, and Sprite runners.

Repo: https://github.com/ponderousdev/foreman — see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the
documentation map, [docs/architecture/README.md](docs/architecture/README.md)
for the architecture, and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for design/UX intent.

## Hard Rules

Non-negotiable, regardless of any autonomy granted elsewhere in this file:

- **Never write to a password manager or credential store unprompted.** Do not
  create, modify, archive, or delete anything in 1Password (items, fields,
  vaults — via the `op` CLI or any other means), OS keychains, or any other
  secret store unless the user explicitly requested that specific write in the
  current conversation. Even when asked, restate exactly what will be written
  and get confirmation before executing — announcing intent and proceeding in
  the same turn is not consent. Read operations (`op read`, `op item list`,
  `op inject` over existing references) are fine.

## Commands

All commands go through the Taskfile (single source of truth — CI, git hooks,
and humans run the same targets):

```bash
task check       # FAST gate (<~1 min) — run constantly; safe for hooks/agents
task verify      # definition-of-done gate — check + validate + test; run before finishing
task ci          # FULL CI mirror — run before/instead of opening a PR
task fix         # auto-format then lint
task test        # tests
task security    # Semgrep CE + gitleaks + dependency audit
```

`check` is deliberately kept fast (lint) so editors, git hooks, and
AI agents can run it on every change without getting bogged down. `verify` is
the definition-of-done gate — check + validate + test plus the quick
Taskfile/hook guards (the Foreman v2 vocabulary: verify = check + build +
test). `ci` is the full pipeline — everything CI runs (`verify` +
`security` + the devcontainer permission assert) — so you can reproduce a CI
run locally on demand instead of waiting on a PR.

## Definition of Done

- `task verify` passes.
- Conventional commit message (types: build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf,
  refactor, revert, style, test).
- Never bypass git hooks (`--no-verify` is forbidden); fix the underlying issue.
- Work on a feature branch; direct commits to `main` are blocked.
- **Never merge to main yourself** — no `gh pr merge`, `git merge`, or push to
  `main` without the maintainer's explicit, per-merge approval, even when CI is
  green and the ruleset would allow it. Open the PR, report that checks pass,
  then stop; merging is always a human decision.
- Releases are intentional: release-please keeps a rolling release PR from
  conventional commits; merging it cuts the tag/release. Nothing bumps on a
  normal merge. `task release:*` remains as a manual override.

## Conventions

Full reference: [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md). Highlights:

- Conventional Commits; `group:action` Taskfile naming (e.g. `lint:shell`, not
  `shell:lint`); pin actions by SHA + `# vX.Y.Z`.
- Git hooks are managed by lefthook (`lefthook.yml`) and delegate to Taskfile
  targets — don't duplicate logic in hooks or workflows.
- Keep Taskfile `cmds:` trivial — inline strings aren't linted (`lint:shell`
  only covers `scripts/*.sh`). Put any pipeline/conditional/loop/`curl | bash`
  in a `scripts/*.sh` the task calls. `task test:tasks` checks the Taskfile
  compiles and setup tasks are safe no-ops.
- Indentation: 2 spaces default, 4 for Python/Terraform/Shell (`.editorconfig`).
- Secrets never go in git; local env via 1Password (`op run` / `op inject`).
- When generating or rotating secrets, keep secret values on stdin and use the
  destination-only helpers:
  `task secret:set:1p VAULT=... ITEM=... FIELD=... [SECTION=...]` for existing
  1Password fields and `task secret:set:gh NAME=... REPO=owner/repo` for GitHub
  repo secrets. Never pass secret values as command arguments, `--body` values,
  exported env vars, or Taskfile vars. The hard rule above still applies:
  agents must not run `secret:set:1p` or otherwise write to a password manager
  without explicit user confirmation for that exact write.
