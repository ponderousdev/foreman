# Project Management

How work is tracked for Foreman in **GitHub Projects**.

## One default project per owner

The standard strategy is a single default GitHub **Project (V2)** per owner — one
board for the organization, or (for personal-account repos) one for the user
account — titled after the owner's GitHub login: `<owner> Project` (here:
**ponderousdev Project**; e.g. `acme Project` for an organization, `octocat Project` for a personal account).
Every repo the owner controls feeds that one board; an issue can belong to
multiple projects, but this default board is its home. Reach for a second,
focused project only when a body of work needs its own.

## Token scopes

Everything on this page that touches the board — `task setup:github-project`,
and the `Status` writes the [claim lifecycle](#claiming--making-an-agents-work-visible-while-it-happens)
makes — goes through the Projects V2 API, and `gh auth login` does **not** grant
access to it by default. Nothing else notices: the same token still reads
issues, opens PRs, and drives CI perfectly well, so the gap shows up only as
board writes that do nothing.

| Scope | Grants | Enough for |
|---|---|---|
| *(neither)* | — | nothing here — every board read and write fails |
| `read:project` | read Projects | reading a card's current `Status`; **no writes** |
| `project` | read **and write** Projects | everything on this page |

### Getting them: `task setup:gh-scopes`

```sh
task setup:gh-scopes
```

**Operator / dev profile only.** It refreshes *your* interactive `gh` login —
so it refuses when a `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` env credential is set (an env
token overrides the stored one, so a refresh would repair something this shell
never uses — reissue that token at its source instead) and refuses without a
TTY, because the flow is an interactive browser device-code exchange and no
agent or CI job should re-mint a human credential. It prints the current
scopes, requests the missing ones, and then **verifies they actually landed** —
`gh auth refresh` can exit 0 having granted less than was asked for.

The raw equivalent, derived from the same list rather than copied out of it —
a hardcoded copy silently goes stale the moment the list changes (an org repo,
for instance, also needs `admin:org`):

```sh
gh auth refresh -s "$(bash -c '. scripts/gh-scopes.sh && gh_scopes_request_list')"
```

To just see what this repo asks for:

```sh
bash -c '. scripts/gh-scopes.sh && gh_scopes_request_list'
```

(Through `bash` on purpose: the helper resolves its own location via
`BASH_SOURCE`, and the devcontainer's default shell is zsh, where sourcing it
directly would resolve the repo root to the wrong directory and silently shrink
the list.)

Check what a token actually carries:

```sh
gh auth status | grep 'Token scopes'
```

### Where the required list lives

One file: `scripts/gh-scopes.sh`. The session-start check in `status.sh`,
`setup-gh-scopes.sh`, and the devcontainer's `gh_auth_help` banner all read it,
so the remedy a warning prints and the scopes the task requests cannot drift
apart. Add your own **without editing the file** by exporting
`GH_EXTRA_SCOPES` (e.g. from `.envrc`):

```sh
export GH_EXTRA_SCOPES="delete_repo"
```

That is **additive**: everything this repo's profile already requires keeps
applying, including anything a later template update introduces.
`GH_REQUIRED_SCOPES` also exists and **replaces** the computed list outright —
an escape hatch that freezes today's defaults. Prefer `GH_EXTRA_SCOPES`.

Whitespace separates requirements; `|` joins alternatives that each satisfy
one. The Projects requirement is present only because this repo has board
tooling — a repo generated without it requires `repo workflow` alone, and is
never warned about a grant it does not use.

### Where it surfaces

`task status:creds` — which the session-start hook runs every session — warns
when the token is missing anything on that list, names the missing scopes, and
prints the remedy. It is silent when the list is satisfied, read-only,
non-fatal, and bounded (one 3s probe; `STATUS_NO_NETWORK=1` skips it). A probe
that cannot answer reports nothing rather than accusing a working credential.

`task status:gh` additionally reports **Project board writes**, a narrower
question: `read:project` satisfies the session-start check but is read-only, so
it fails that one. `task setup:github-project` refuses to run without `project`
rather than failing partway through its writes.

Two adjacent scopes, for completeness: an organization's **issue types** need
`admin:org` (reported by `task status:setup`), and the vendored claim skills
hint at `gh auth refresh -s read:project,project` — equivalent for this purpose,
since `project` alone already covers it.

### Scopes are only half the story

The table above is about **classic OAuth scopes**, which is what `gh auth login`
issues and `gh auth refresh` edits. A **fine-grained PAT** or a GitHub App
installation token has none of them: its Projects access is a *permission*
granted where the token was issued. `gh auth status` reports no scope list for
one, so `task status:gh` can only report the check as **unknown**, and
`gh auth refresh` cannot help — a token supplied through the environment as
`GH_TOKEN` cannot be refreshed at all. Grant it **Projects: Read and write** at
the source (organization permissions, for an org-owned board) instead.
That matters here because the bot credential this template documents
([bot-account.md](guides/bot-account.md)) deliberately grants it **`Projects:
Read and write`** — so an agent running as the bot **can** move cards through
the claim lifecycle as documented below. The cost is that organization
permissions are not bounded by the token's repository list; that write reaches
every board the org owns. Accepting that radius is a deliberate decision
recorded in [security.md](architecture/security.md), and the trade is stated
where the permission is granted
([bot-account.md](guides/bot-account.md),
[branch-protection.md](architecture/branch-protection.md)).

## Status pipeline

`Status` is a single-select field with exactly one meaning: **where in the flow
toward delivery is this.** The columns, grouped:

**Backlog** — triage; not yet committed

- Inbox — newly landed, unsorted
- Icebox — real, but not now
- Next — will pull in soon

**Unstarted** — committed to a cycle, not yet in motion

- Todo
- Shaping — problem/approach still being defined
- Ready — shaped, ready to pick up
- Agent Queue — queued for an AI agent to implement

**Started** — in motion, partial progress

- In Progress
- Verifying — CI/checks running
- In Review — under human review
- Ready to Merge — approved, awaiting merge

**Completed**

- Done — merged/shipped; the single terminal status
- Deployed
- Accepted — smoke/QA/manual check passed, communicated, released

Archiving isn't a status — it's a separate native axis. GitHub's built-in
**auto-archive** removes finished items from the board (into the retrievable
Archived-items view), so aged `Done` items leave the board automatically instead
of sitting in an "Archived" column.

**Agent Queue is the hand-off lane to AI coding agents.** An item lands there once
it's shaped and ready for an *agent* rather than a human to implement — a
**`suggest:*`** label says which family (and optionally model) should take it.
The hand-off itself is manual: suggest the agent, then trigger it — an
`@claude` mention naming `implement` (see
[The Claude Actions workflows](#the-claude-actions-workflows)), or point Claude
Code at the item. The lane is built for automation, though — an agent can watch
*Agent Queue + suggest-labelled + priority* (the Agent-queue view below) and
pull the top item on its own — and either way the item moves to **In Progress**
once work starts.

## Status is not issue state

GitHub has **two independent state machines**, and conflating them is the most
common way to make a board lie:

- **Issue state** — `open` / `closed`, native to the issue.
- **Status** — the custom pipeline field above, layered on top.

`Status` answers *"where in the delivery flow is this."* It is **not** where you
record *why something left the flow without shipping* — GitHub has a dedicated
axis for that, the **close reason**.

### Canceled and Duplicate are close reasons, not statuses

They aren't pipeline positions; they're terminal closure reasons, and GitHub
already has an axis for those that's separate from `Status` by design. When you
close an issue you pick **Completed**, **Not planned**, or **Duplicate**:

- **Cancel / won't-fix / stale** → close as **Not planned** — explicitly the
  bucket for exactly this.
- **Duplicate** → close as **Duplicate** (shipped December 2024). You select the
  duplicated issue, which produces a timeline event and a note at the top making
  the closure reason clear.

Neither needs a `Status` value, and **Done** stays the single terminal status
meaning "shipped." Why not add `Canceled`/`Duplicate` columns anyway, given
Linear has a Canceled group? Because in Linear the status *is* the state, so
"Canceled" closes the work atomically with that meaning. GitHub split them:
`Status` is a custom field layered on an issue that keeps its own independent
open/closed state.

### Automation gotcha

The built-in **"issue closed → Done"** rule doesn't look at *why* the issue
closed, so closing something as Not planned or Duplicate would paint it **Done**
on the board — wrong. Gate it:

- Drive Done off **"PR merged → Done"** for the success path.
- Leave the built-in **"item closed → Done"** rule **off**. Only a custom
  Action can read `state_reason`, and none ships here — so the built-in is the
  whole of what that rule would do, and it cannot tell a shipped issue from an
  abandoned one.

Items closed as not-planned/duplicate just stay closed and fall off the board;
their `Status` value goes vestigial, which is fine — nothing open-filtered shows
them.

## Blocked is not a status

A `Blocked` column buys you visibility you already get for free, and it fights
automation: statuses are artifact-driven (PR opened → Verifying) while "blocked"
is a manual human overlay — an item that's "Blocked" but has an open PR is a
contradiction the automation can't resolve. Blocked is **orthogonal** to pipeline
position; keep it off that axis. There are two kinds, and they want different
tools:

- **Blocked by another issue** (the common case) — use the native **"Mark as
  blocked by"** relationship (issue dependencies, GA 2025-08-21). It records
  *what's* blocking (the actual issue, not a bare flag), shows the **Blocked**
  icon on the board and Issues page automatically, is queryable with
  `is:blocked`, and is fully programmatic (`gh issue view` shows Blocked by /
  Blocking; `--json blockedBy,blocking`; REST endpoints add/list/remove).
  When the blocker closes, the relationship reflects it. Up to 50 issues per
  relationship type.
- **Blocked by a non-issue** — waiting on a Twilio 10DLC approval, an upstream
  library fix, a pricing decision, info from a customer. The native feature can't
  express this (an issue only becomes "blocked" by depending on another issue),
  so this is the **`blocked` label's** job: it means "stuck on a non-issue
  thing," with the actual reason in a comment.

One upgrade for that second case: model a *significant or shared* external
blocker as its own **tracking issue** ("Twilio 10DLC brand approval") and mark
the real work blocked-by it — that pulls the external dependency into the native
mechanism (board icon, `is:blocked`, auto-resolve). Worth it when several items
wait on the same thing; reserve the bare label for one-off, transient blockers.

## Automations

Projects are **org-level** objects, but automations trigger from **events**, and
issue/PR events are repo-local. That splits automation three ways:

1. **Triggered by repo activity (issue/PR events)** — the workflow *must* live in
   the repo where the activity happens; a workflow in one repo never sees
   another's PR events. In a polyrepo org the same automation runs in every repo
   whose issues/PRs feed the project.
   Foreman ships one as `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`,
   syncing `Status` from PR/CI events.
2. **Triggered by a schedule or `workflow_dispatch`** — no per-repo trigger to
   distribute, so pick one hub/ops repo and run it there.
3. **Not an Action at all** — the project's **built-in workflows**.

Start with #3: **push everything you can onto the built-in workflows.** They're
configured on the project itself, fire on project-item events, and work
org-project-wide across every repo with zero Actions and zero per-repo setup —
Backlog on add, In Review on review-requested, Done on merge, Done on close,
auto-close, auto-archive. Drop to Actions only for the gaps built-ins don't
cover.

What is automated, and by which of the three:

| Event | Sets `Status` to | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Item added to the project | **Inbox** | built-in workflow |
| PR opened / pushed to / reopened | **Verifying** | Actions (`project-automation.yml`) |
| Build run completes without failing | **In Review** | Actions (`project-automation.yml`) — any conclusion outside `failure`/`cancelled`/`timed_out`/`action_required` counts, so `skipped`, `neutral` and `startup_failure` advance the card too |
| Build run concludes `failure`, `cancelled`, `timed_out` or `action_required` | **Verifying** (stays) | Actions (`project-automation.yml`) |
| Review submitted as approved | **Ready to Merge** | Actions (`project-automation.yml`) — only when the PR's `reviewDecision` is `APPROVED`; head repo and reviewer association are pre-filters |
| PR merged | **Done** | Actions (`project-automation.yml`) + built-in |
| Issue closed, for any reason | *(nothing)* | not automated — see below |
| PR closed unmerged | *(nothing)* | deliberately not automated |
| 90 days in Done | **auto-archived** off the board | built-in auto-archive (not a `Status`) |

`In Progress` is deliberately **not** automated: it means a human or an agent
picked the work up, which happens before any artifact exists to trigger on. It
is written by the [claim lifecycle](#claiming--making-an-agents-work-visible-while-it-happens).

**Closing an issue moves nothing, on purpose.** Nothing shipped here listens for
`issues: closed`, and GitHub's built-in "item closed → Done" rule cannot read
the close reason — so leave that built-in **off**. Turned on, it paints every
issue closed as *Not planned* or *Duplicate* **Done**, which is exactly the
misfiling the [close-reason axis](#canceled-and-duplicate-are-close-reasons-not-statuses)
exists to prevent, and every one of them needs correcting by hand. Left off,
`Done` keeps meaning shipped: it arrives from the merge path above, and the
occasional issue that completes without a merged PR is moved by hand. An issue
closed as not-planned simply keeps whatever `Status` it had — vestigial, and
invisible to every open-filtered view.

The Actions half is `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`. It resolves the
issue from the PR's `claude/issue-N` branch name or a `Closes` / `Fixes` /
`Resolves` reference in the PR body.

**Only this repository's own branches move the board.** The branch name is the
routing key and its author chooses it, so a fork pushing `claude/issue-N` would
otherwise steer issue N's card. Trust comes from the head *repository*
instead: a `pull_request`, `workflow_run` or `pull_request_review` event whose
head repo is not this repository is not acted on. On the review path that test — plus a reviewer
`author_association` of `OWNER`, `MEMBER` or `COLLABORATOR` — is only a
pre-filter, keeping fork events and drive-by approvals from consuming a runner
and minting the App token. It is not the authorization: association is not a
permission, and `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR` include read-only and triage access.

**Ready to Merge is written only when the PR's `reviewDecision` is `APPROVED`.**
The event says somebody approved; `reviewDecision` is GitHub's own computation
of whether the PR *is* approved — required reviewers honoured, dismissals and
stale reviews accounted for — which is exactly what the status means. Any other
value logs and writes nothing. That includes an **empty** decision, which is
what GitHub returns when no required-review rule exists at all, even after a
genuine approval: this repository's ruleset requires code-owner review, so an
empty value means the rule is missing rather than the PR being approved. The
board write is advisory state and merging stays ruleset-protected either way;
this keeps the card honest, it is not the merge security.

The status write itself is `continue-on-error`, so a board that cannot be
written never fails a build. That tolerance starts *after* the App token is
minted, though — missing `CI_APP_CLIENT_ID` / `CI_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, or an App
without **Projects: Read and write**, fails the token step, and
`project-automation-verify` fails with it.

## Fields

`Status` is a **Project field** — the board pipeline above; it stays on the
project because the built-in workflows (and `project-automation.yml`, on an org)
drive it.

The work-metadata fields:

- **Priority** — Urgent / High / Medium / Low
- **Size** — estimation points on the Fibonacci ladder (1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 8 / 13 / 21),
  a project **number** field so a view can sum it per group
- **Product** — which product/area it belongs to (free text)

There is deliberately **no `Agent` field**. Which agent *should* take an issue
is the `suggest:*` label family plus the `Status: Agent Queue` lane; which agent
*is* working it is the claim label (see **Claiming** below). A field could carry
neither answer without duplicating the label vocabulary, and on an organization
the Projects V2 API could not even write it — see
[Label or field?](#label-or-field).

There is likewise deliberately **no `Domain` or `Layer` field** (harmon-init#875). Both
used to exist as a field *and* a label — `domain:` / `layer:` below — with
nothing syncing an issue's field value to its label, which is exactly the
[Label or field?](#label-or-field) trade-off: a label is readable without
project scope, writable with plain repo scope, and available on personal
repos, none of which the field bought back. Since one surface has to be the
source of truth and the label already was for anyone living in `gh issue list`,
the field was the redundant one.

**Migrating a board that still has one** (set up before a field was retired):
the setup scripts are additive-only by design, so deleting a live field is an
explicit operator step, and reviewing its values comes first — deleting a field
destroys every value on it, unrecoverably.

- **Agent** (retired earlier):
  1. Provision the replacement vocabulary first: run `task setup:github-labels`
     in every repository whose issues carry the field — a `suggest:*` label must
     exist in a repo before an assignment can be copied onto its issues.
  2. List what the field holds — filter the Project's own board/table view by
     the field, not a capped CLI listing (`gh project item-list` defaults to a
     page size well under a typical board, and `gh issue list` won't show
     draft items at all): every issue or board item with `Agent` set,
     including **draft items**, which can carry the project field but can
     never carry a label. Convert any draft whose assignment you want to keep
     into an issue first; a draft you leave as-is loses its assignment with
     the field.
  3. Carry each assignment you still want over as the matching `suggest:*` label
     on the issue (e.g. `Agent: Claude Code` → `suggest:claude`).
  4. Re-point the saved **Agent queue** view (below) at the new predicate —
     filter on the `suggest:*` labels instead of the `Agent` field. A view still
     filtered on the field loses its routing predicate the moment the field is
     deleted.
  5. Only then delete the field — Project settings → the field → *Delete field*
     on a personal project. On an organization the field is **org-wide**:
     deleting it under **Settings → Planning → Issue fields** removes the value
     from every issue in every repository and project the org owns, not just
     this board — repeat steps 2–4 across the whole organization before
     deleting, including step 4 for **every** Project whose saved views filter
     on the field, not just the board being migrated.
- **Domain / Layer** (retired by harmon-init#875): `domain:*`/`layer:*` are provisioned
  by default, so most repos already carry them — but don't skip the
  provisioning step on that assumption; confirm it.
  1. Provision the replacement vocabulary first, the same as Agent: run
     `task setup:github-labels` in every repository whose issues carry the
     field. An org-wide issue field is shared by every repo in the org, and
     labels are not — a repo that never ran the script has neither label
     family yet.
  2. List every issue with `Domain`/`Layer` set.
     This is an **org issue field** — the value lives on the issue
     independent of project membership, so an issue can carry it without
     belonging to the Project you're migrating from. A single Project's
     filtered view is therefore NOT a complete inventory: check the org's
     issue-field settings (**Settings → Planning → Issue fields** → the
     field) and sweep every repository/project in the org, not just the one
     board. There are no draft items to convert here — a draft project item
     isn't a real issue, so it can never carry an org issue field in the
     first place.
     For each item, add the matching `domain:*`/`layer:*` label — **creating
     it first** if the field carries a custom option (e.g. `Domain: crm`)
     that has no label counterpart yet, since the starter set
     `setup:github-labels` provisioned is only a floor. Nothing kept the two
     in sync, so do not assume the label already exists just because the
     field option does.
  3. Re-point any saved view that **groups, filters, or sorts** by the
     `Domain`/`Layer` field. A label can still filter a view (`domain:auth`,
     say), but — unlike a field — a project view cannot **group or sort** by a
     label, so a view built for the per-domain/per-layer rollup or ordering
     loses that; keep the grouping on `Product` (still a field) and reach for
     a label filter instead.
  4. Only then delete the field(s) — Project settings → the field → *Delete
     field* on a personal project; **Settings → Planning → Issue fields** on an
     organization, org-wide as above.

**Priority and Product are org issue fields**: org-level, defined once, and —
unlike a project field — the value lives on the **issue**, stays consistent
across every project the issue belongs to, and shows in the issue timeline.
GitHub ships **Priority** and **Effort** (plus **Start date** / **Target
date**) built in, left at their defaults, so `task setup:github-issue-fields`
only adds **Product**.

**Size is the exception — a project number field** (created by
`task setup:github-project`): project views can group, filter, and sort by
issue-field columns, but group-header **sums** only work for project **number**
fields, and the per-group sum is Size's whole job (see the Planning view). An
issue field's type also can't be changed after creation, so the built-in
single-select `Effort` issue field can't hold the numeric estimate — leave it at
its default (a coarse gut-check) and put points in `Size`.

### The provisioned field values

What the setup scripts actually create. Every single-select is a **starter
set**: re-runs append missing options and never rename, reorder, or delete, so
options you add in the UI survive and a value added by a later template release
lands on the next run.

| Field | Type | Values | Provisioned by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Status** | project single-select | Inbox, Icebox, Next, Todo, Shaping, Ready, Agent Queue, In Progress, Verifying, In Review, Ready to Merge, Done, Deployed, Accepted | `setup:github-project` |
| **Size** | project number | free numeric entry; the Fibonacci ladder (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) is a convention, not an option list | `setup:github-project` |
| **Priority** | org issue field | GitHub's built-in field, left at its defaults | GitHub |
| **Product** | org issue field, text | free text | `setup:github-issue-fields` |

GitHub also ships **Effort**, **Start date**, and **Target date** as built-in
issue fields, left at their defaults. `Effort` cannot hold the estimate: an
issue field's type is fixed at creation, and only project **number** fields can
be summed in a view's group header, which is `Size`'s whole job.

## Issue types → commit types → releases

The **issue type** (Bug / Feature / Task / Research) is an org-level, largely
downstream-inert categorization — your preference for slicing the board; nothing
automated reads it. It maps **many-to-one** onto the load-bearing
conventional-commit types (see [conventions.md](conventions.md)), which are the
only thing release-please reads to cut a version:

| Issue type | Commit type(s) | release-please |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bug** | `fix` | Bug Fixes → patch |
| **Feature** | `feat` (`feat!` = breaking) | Features → minor (major) |
| **Task** | `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `perf`, `refactor`, `style`, `test` | none on their own |
| **Research** | usually `docs`, or no code (the outcome is a decision) | none |

Types are GitHub's defaults (Bug, Feature, Task) plus Research, kept in sync by
`task setup:github-issue-types`. A `Task` issue almost always ships as `chore` —
there is no `task:` commit type, by design.

## Labels

Labels are **repo-level** and orthogonal to `Status` (pipeline position) and
`Type` (kind of work) — they tag cross-cutting *facets*, with one exception:
personal-account repos have no native issue Type, so six labels (`bug`,
`feature`, `documentation`, `question`, `task`, `research`) carry that
classification instead; an organization carries it in `Type` alone and never
applies any of the six. Four of them — `bug`, `feature`, `task`,
`research` — are form-backed, applied automatically by the matching issue
form; `documentation` and `question` have no dedicated form and are applied
by hand. Keep the rest in a few families, color-coded by family; the
vocabulary lives in
[`label-registry.json`](../label-registry.json) (the machine-readable manifest
the taxonomy table below is generated from) and the starter set is created by
`task setup:github-labels`:

- **Concerns** — cross-cutting facets worth filtering on: security,
  accessibility, performance, tech debt, internationalization
- **Source** — where the work came from (a customer request, AI authorship) —
  durable provenance, never removed
- **Workflow** — transient triage states; `blocked` is the non-issue-blocker
  flag described above
- **Layer** — which stack slice the change lives in
- **Domain** — which product capability the work serves (the *problem* space).
  Domain values are per-repository vocabulary — grow them from your product's
  own capabilities; the label family is the only surface for this taxonomy
- **Work type** — what kind of work the issue is, on personal-account repos
  where native issue Type is unavailable; the issue forms apply it, and org
  repos use native Type with no work-type label
- **Area** — which codebase subsystem the work lives in (the *solution*
  space). At most one each of `area:`/`domain:`/`layer:` per issue. On these
  exclusive axes, a generic bucket defers to the most specific matching value;
  write that single-owner boundary into the value's registry description
  rather than leaving it implicit
- **Tier** — which model-routing stratum should work the issue — advisory,
  human-written, and inert until a consumer resolves it under its own trust
  model
- **Method** — the execution topology to work the issue under — advisory,
  like `tier:`
- **Rigor** — which round-cap level in [`.devflow.toml`](../.devflow.toml) an
  agent works the issue under (AGENTS.md, "Round caps are resolved, not stated
  here"). An agent reads it and never self-applies one. It is advisory rather
  than an authenticated gate: nothing verifies who applied it, and the
  **triage** role can label an issue with no push access — so AGENTS.md
  requires any cap or floor resolving below `default_rigor` to be stated in
  the PR body, keeping a reduced budget visible to the reviewer — the
  `min_rounds` floor included. Two present resolve per stage to the highest
  cap, and the floor likewise to the highest present, so a conflict can only
  ever buy more review.

The prose above describes what each family *means*; the actual values — names,
colors, writers, lifecycle — live in `label-registry.json` and appear in the
generated taxonomy table below, so vocabulary is never restated here.

Two more families name **model intelligence** rather than a facet of the work,
and their vocabulary is not hand-listed anywhere: it is rendered from
`agent-registry.json` (see [Agent families and harnesses](#agent-families-and-harnesses)),
so provisioning and documentation cannot fork from each other.

- **Suggest** — `suggest:<family>` — which agent family
  *should* implement the issue, set at triage. Advisory only: it routes
  nothing by itself and must never be read as Foreman arming (that is the
  `foreman:*` family). A model-level label (`suggest:<family>:<model>`, created on
  demand) **refines** the family label, never replaces it — apply both, so
  views filtered on the family labels keep seeing the issue
- **Claim** — `claim:<family>` — which agent family is working
  the issue *right now*, written by the agent itself (see **Claiming** below).
  Model-level (`claim:<family>:<model>`) refines it the same way

The `layer:`, `domain:`, and `area:` families are the *only* surface for this
taxonomy (see Fields) — there is no more paired project/issue field to keep
in step with, so extend the label lists alone as the product grows. `domain:`
(problem space) and `area:` (solution space) are both per-repository
vocabulary whose starter values are a floor; `layer:` is product-independent
and normally needs no edits.

The `claim:` and `suggest:` families share a vocabulary and *nothing else*.
`suggest:` is the planned implementer, `claim:` is the active one — see
**Claiming** below. Never treat one as a copy of the other: rewriting the
suggestion to match the claim overwrites a planning decision.

GitHub labels live per-repository (there's no shared org label pool).
`setup-github-labels` seeds the set into one repo — run it in each, or set the
org's **default labels** (org Settings → Repository, UI-only) to seed *new* repos
(it won't change existing ones). It never deletes labels, so GitHub's defaults
remain until you prune them — including a pre-`ui`/`logic`/`data`/`integration`
repo's `layer:frontend`, `layer:backend`, and `layer:infra`, which you re-map and
delete by hand.

### Labels carry no permissions

**GitHub has no per-label permission.** Anyone with triage access to the repo
can apply or remove any label, and the label itself records nothing about who
did — a label is a string on an issue, not a capability. So a label can never
be the security boundary. The boundary is always in the **consumer**: whatever
reads a label to start work must independently establish who applied it, and
refuse when it cannot.

That rule has a hard form: **any label that triggers automation must have an
actor-verifying consumer.** Here that class is exactly the Foreman arming
labels. Every other family either triggers nothing, or is read by a consumer
that can only stop work:

| Family | Triggers execution? | How the consumer establishes trust |
|---|---|---|
| `foreman:<adapter>`, `foreman:approved` | **yes** — arms an issue for dispatch | Foreman reads the `labeled` **timeline event**, takes the actor from it, and requires that login in `trusted_actors` (`.foreman.toml`). Unattributable arming is a fail-closed refusal, never a dispatch — which is also why issue-field arming is refused outright: GitHub exposes no actor for a field change |
| the Claude Actions workflows | **no** — labels trigger nothing at all | Execution starts only on an explicit `@claude` mention naming `plan`, `implement`, or `review`, from a login on the workflow's sender allowlist. The allowlist is enforced in the job `if:` and re-asserted in a token-free step *before* any credential is minted |
| `claim:*` (and legacy `agent:*`) | **no** — read as a gate, not a trigger | Those workflows refuse to start on a target that already carries one. No actor check is needed for a signal that can only *withhold* execution: the worst outcome is a visible, reversible refusal |
| `autorelease: *` | **no** | release-please writes them on its own release PRs and reads only what it wrote; nothing dispatches from one |
| everything else | **no** | human-facing facets, read by people and saved views |

There are no `claude-plan` / `claude-implement` / `claude-review` **trigger**
labels, for exactly this reason: a `labeled` event carries an actor, but the
label sitting on the issue afterwards does not, so half the paths a
label-triggered workflow can start from have nobody to check. Label setup is
additive, so a repository standardized before those labels were retired may
still carry them live-but-inert — delete them by hand.

### Label or field?

Both surfaces can hold the same-looking datum, so the choice is made on
mechanics, not taste. Use a **label** when the datum must be any of:

- **multi-valued** — an issue can legitimately carry two at once;
- **visible without project scope** — readable from `gh issue list` and the
  issue page, with no Projects API token;
- **writable with plain repo scope** — no `project` scope, no org permission;
- **timeline-attributable** — the `labeled` event records who applied it and
  when;
- **available on personal repos** — org issue fields do not exist there.

Use a **field** when it is **single-valued planning metadata you slice the
board by**: `Status`, `Priority`, `Size`, `Product`.

The consequences are not stylistic. Foreman arming is labels because only
the label timeline names an arming actor. Claims are labels because a claim
must be writable and visible to an agent holding nothing but repo scope, on
personal and org repos alike. And there is deliberately no `Agent` field:
advisory routing and live ownership are two different facts, a single-select
could carry neither without duplicating the label vocabulary, and on an
organization the Projects V2 API could not write it at all. `Domain` and `Layer` were fields once
too, and were retired for the same reason: a label already covered every one of
the bullets above and nothing kept the two surfaces in sync (harmon-init#875).

### The complete label taxonomy

Every label family this repository knows about, **generated from the
machine-readable manifest** — [`label-registry.json`](../label-registry.json)
holds the families, values, colors, writers, lifecycle, and per-value
overrides, and `task test:label-registry` fails when this table drifts from
it. **Provisioned** means `task setup:github-labels` creates it; **tool-owned**
means the tool that uses it creates it on demand, and provisioning
deliberately leaves it alone.

| `foreman:ready-for-review` | Foreman, on passing its readiness gate | Foreman, humans | **tool-owned, auto-created** | added at promotion; the hand-off to human review |
| `type:<commit-type>` | a human, optionally | Foreman, to pick the unit's conventional-commit type | **not provisioned** — an optional override of the native issue `Type` | applied when the native type is absent or wrong |
| `autorelease: pending`, `autorelease: tagged` | release-please | release-please | **tool-owned, auto-created**; note the space after the colon — not part of the `family:value` convention | pending on the open release PR, tagged once the release is cut |
| `duplicate`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `wontfix` | GitHub, at repo creation | humans | not provisioned, never deleted by setup | prune by hand if you do not want them |
<!-- label-taxonomy:end -->

One nuance the table compresses: `claim:claude` in a repo with **no label
provisioning at all** is tool-owned in practice — the Claude Actions run
auto-creates it with the registry's own color and description, so a later
provisioning run reconciles it rather than fighting it.

Foreman's PR-side labels are namespaced on purpose: every label Foreman reads
or writes lives under `foreman:`, so the arming inputs and the lifecycle
outputs are one legible namespace. `foreman:ready-for-review` is the accurate
name for what promotion means — the automated work is complete and a human is
now being asked to review it. Approval stays GitHub's native review decision,
and merging stays human-only.

### Agent families and harnesses

Every agent-vocabulary label comes from one machine-readable source,
`agent-registry.json`, validated against `agent-registry.schema.json`. Its two
axes are deliberately distinct: a **family** is the model intelligence doing
the reasoning, a **harness** is the executable that runs it. `suggest:` and
`claim:` name families; `foreman:<adapter>` names harness machinery.

The tables below are **generated** from that file — `task test:registry-docs`
regenerates them and fails on any difference, so they cannot drift from what
provisioning actually creates. Model-level labels are created on demand rather
than seeded. A `foreman:` selector is provisioned only for an adapter that
exists and is production-dispatchable in the pinned Foreman release: a selector
with no adapter behind it is a false capability that can strand armed work.

## Claiming — making an agent's work visible while it happens

An issue being worked on *right now* is the one fact the tracker holds worst.
The assignee is buried on the issue page and a claim comment is one entry in a
thread — neither shows on the board, which is where work is actually watched.
So two agents, or an agent and a human, start the same issue because nothing
visible said it was taken.

An agent starting work therefore writes every one of these it *can*, because
each is blind where the others see:

| Signal | Answers | Shows up in |
|---|---|---|
| `Status` = `In Progress` | where it is in delivery | the board |
| claim label (`claim:*`; `agent:*` pre-migration) | which agent is working it **right now** | the issue page, `gh issue list --label` |
| assignee | that *someone* has it | notifications, `gh issue list --assignee` |

**`suggest:*` is not on that list, and a claim must not write it.** The two
look like the same fact and are not:

| | Means | Set by | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`suggest:*`** label | which agent *should* implement it | whoever plans/triages | at planning, before the work starts |
| **`claim:*`** label | which agent *is* implementing it | the agent itself | at claim, released at hand-off |

They share one vocabulary — the agent-registry families — but they answer
different questions. Rewriting the suggestion at claim time would destroy the
planning assignment the **Agent queue** view is built on (that view lists
issues *carrying a `suggest:*` label*), and would silently reassign work
planned for one agent to whichever agent happened to pick it up.

So a claim writes the **claim label only**. If the claim and the suggestion
disagree, that is information, not drift: it means a different agent picked up
work planned for another one. Worth noticing, not worth auto-correcting.

Both being labels, the model works identically on both owner types — there is
no org issue field in the claim path for the Projects V2 API to be unable to
write.

These labels ship with `task setup:github-labels`, which is generated only for
`project_management: github`. A repo on `none` or `linear` gets no label
families at all, so a claim there rests on the assignee and the claim comment.

**A board write can fail without anyone learning.** Every `Status` write in the
lifecycle needs the [`project` scope](#token-scopes). Without it each one exits
2 — "could not verify" — and the steps handle that correctly *individually*:
it is an auth condition they cannot fix, so they note it and carry on. In
aggregate that is the worst outcome available. The agent reports the issue
claimed, the board says nothing was ever started, and neither is wrong from
where it stands; the hand-back then cannot restore a prior status it was never
able to read. Nothing in the loop escalates, so the board silently stops
tracking agent work in **both** directions until a human happens to notice it
has gone stale. Check the scope at session start (`task status:gh`), not after
the claim.

**How much a claim prevents depends on who is reading it.** The label is one
string, but it has two very different consumers:

- **Interactive sessions — a signal, not a lock.** None of these writes is
  atomic, and two sessions running as the same GitHub user are invisible to
  each other: the assignee converges, the label is idempotent, and the field is
  last-writer-wins. A claim makes concurrent work discoverable by a human; it
  does not prevent it.
- **The Claude Actions workflows — a fail-closed gate.** A run refuses to
  start on a target that already carries any `claim:*` or `agent:*` label, and
  says which one. That is enforcement, not advice, and it is why a stale claim
  blocks mentions on that issue until somebody removes the label.

The gap between the two is deliberate rather than unfinished: a workflow run
has one entry point to gate, while an interactive session can start anywhere,
so promising a lock there would be a promise the mechanism cannot keep.

**A claim must be released.** `In Progress` left on finished or abandoned work
is worse than no signal, because the next reader believes it. The lifecycle
follows the pipeline honestly — `In Progress` at claim, `Verifying` while CI
runs, `In Review` awaiting a human, `Ready to Merge` only once actually
approved, and never `Done`, which belongs to whoever merges. On org repos
`project-automation.yml` already syncs `Status` from PR and CI events; anything
writing the card should defer to it there rather than racing it.

**A session cannot be relied on to release it.** The release is owed after the
merge, and no session is guaranteed to witness that: `/shepherd` stops before
the merge on policy, so the session that claimed the issue is usually over by
the time a human merges. `.github/workflows/claim-release.yml` is the release —
on `issues closed` (by any means) and on `pull_request closed` **unmerged**, it
undoes what the claim record says the claim added and posts the `Claim
released —` supersede comment. It needs no secret beyond `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

That workflow runs `release-claim.sh` out of the vendored `track-work` skill,
so it does nothing until you have run `task sync:skills` — which is also when
the skills that *write* claims arrive, so the two are never out of step. The
contract it parses, and the gaps it deliberately does not cover (a merged PR
with no closing keyword, an unmerged fork PR), are in
`.claude/skills/track-work/references/claim-lifecycle.md`.

### The Claude Actions workflows

`claude-plan.yml`, `claude-implement.yml`, and `claude-review.yml` run Claude
Code on an issue or PR from inside GitHub Actions. Three properties define how
they start, and all three exist because of the label boundary above.

**Mention-only.** The single way a run starts is a comment or review body that
carries an `@claude` mention followed by `plan`, `implement`, or `review`.
There is no label trigger, no `issues: opened`, and no `issues: assigned`
trigger. Every one of those carries no actor the workflow can check on every
path.

**Sender-gated.** The mention only counts from a login on the workflow's
authorized-sender allowlist (the `claude_authorized_members` answer). The
answer is not the whole list: the review workflow additionally authorizes
`renovate[bot]` and `dependabot[bot]` as senders, so their update PRs can request
their own reviews — treat those fixed bot principals as part of the trust
surface when auditing. The allowlist is checked twice — in the job `if:`, and
again in a token-free step that re-asserts it *before* any App token is
minted — so a gap in the expression can never mint a credential.

**Claim-aware, fail-closed.** After the sender gate passes and before the token
is minted, the run acquires `claim:claude` on the target:

| Situation | What the run does |
|---|---|
| Target is unclaimed and the label lands | claims it and runs |
| Event has no issue or PR number | runs unclaimed — there is nothing to collide with |
| Target already carries any `claim:*` or `agent:*` label | **refuses**, naming the held label and the remedy |
| The label list cannot be read | **refuses** — it cannot prove the target is free |
| The label will not apply | **refuses** — it would work the target unmarked |

`suggest:*` is deliberately not matched: it is advice about who *should* do the
work, never ownership of it. The label is created if the repository does not
have it, with the registry's own color and description, so a later
`task setup:github-labels` reconciles that label instead of fighting it.

Release is loud, and bounded. An `always()` step releases the claim — but only
when *this* run acquired it, so a claim that was already there is never stolen.
It covers the failure, step-timeout and cancellation paths, which is why the
model step carries a cap well inside the job's: a job-level timeout kills the
runner outright and the cleanup never runs at all. A release that cannot be
confirmed retries once and then turns the job **red** with the marker still on
the issue, because a release reported as successful over a surviving label
would be permanent — the next run reads the claim, records that it did not
acquire it, and never cleans it either.

It is not a guarantee. Runner loss, a force-cancel, or the job cap firing can
strand `claim:claude` with no cleanup at all, and a stranded claim blocks
further mentions on that target until somebody removes the label by hand. That
residual is accepted rather than reconciled by a workflow of its own.

Because acquiring is a read-then-add, the three workflows share one job-level
`concurrency` group keyed on the target number, so two runs on the same issue
serialize instead of both reading "unclaimed". The group is job-level rather
than workflow-level on purpose: these workflows fire on every comment event and
filter in the job `if:`, so a workflow-level group would let ordinary comments
queue up and displace legitimate runs.

## Milestones

A milestone has **one job — "which finite, shippable batch is this part of?"** —
and nothing else. Four things
could all masquerade as milestones, so keep the lanes clean:

- **Type** — what kind of work (Bug / Feature / Task / Research)
- **Status** — where it sits in the pipeline
- **Labels** — orthogonal, cross-cutting concerns
- **Sub-issues** — hierarchy

None of those answers *"which shippable batch does this belong to, and how done
is that batch?"* — that's the milestone's unique contribution: a finite
delivery container with a **live completion bar** and, when useful, a due date.
Labels are for classification; milestones are for goal tracking. An open-ended
concern with no completion condition is still a label or saved view.

Use one of two explicit milestone naming modes:

- **Version milestone** — for a product release planned as a version, make the
  title equal the git tag (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`). The milestone is the pre-ship
  "what must land before this version" artifact; release-please is the post-merge
  machine that calculates and cuts the actual version from conventional commits
  (see [conventions.md](conventions.md)). The shipped
  `close-milestone-on-release.yml` Action closes the milestone matching a
  published tag, and the release PR can carry it too.
- **Scope-batch milestone** — for a rolling-release or tooling repo where
  versions are outputs rather than planning inputs, name the finite outcome
  (`Issue strategy overhaul`, `Runner hardening`). It may span several releases;
  close it when its scoped issues are complete. Release-please continues to
  version each shipped increment independently, and the tag-matching Action
  intentionally does not close a non-version milestone.

Do not mix the two modes in one title or invent a version for work whose version
is not known yet. **Carry one active delivery milestone per stream** — create it
when it has real scope, close it when that scope ships, and open the next only as
needed rather than keeping speculative batches in competition.

**Due dates are signals, not gates.** A milestone's due date is optional, does
not block a merge or close, and triggers nothing. Add one when a collaborator
needs a timing signal and update it honestly when the plan slips; the milestone's
scope and completion bar remain useful without a fabricated date.

## Milestones over iterations

For pre-launch product development, lead with **milestones, not iterations**
(sprints). The mechanisms differ in what they fix vs. flex:

- **Iterations fix time, flex scope** — the window ends Friday, you ship whatever's
  done.
- **Milestones fix scope, flex time** — you ship when the thing is done; the date
  is a signal.

Early product work needs to **fix scope**: a half-built product at an arbitrary
time-box boundary isn't shippable value — "ship it when it's good enough to charge
for" is a scope commitment, not a time one. Here the milestone's commitment shape
is right and the iteration's is actively wrong.

**Incremental delivery doesn't come from either mechanism** — it comes from **small
slices + frequent deploys + a release cadence**, which you already have (PR-sized
sub-issues, per-PR previews to prod, release-please cutting incremental releases
from accumulated commits). You can sprint and ship zero user value, or run
milestones and ship continuously; the delivery job routes through the *release*
mechanism (milestone-adjacent), not sprints.

**So run small, frequent milestones** — a shippable chunk every ~2–4 weeks, not one
giant "Launch." A tightly-scoped milestone with a target date is a chunk of value
with an expectation attached, doing three jobs at once: coordination (toward
shippable scope), commitment (to that scope; date as signal), and incremental
delivery (frequent small releases). It's literally the release-please flow —
**small frequent milestones == frequent delivery batches** — so it's one rhythm,
not two, even when a rolling-release repo cuts several versions inside one
scope-batch milestone.

**Get the forcing-function from tools you already have,** not a sprint clock: a
**WIP limit** on `In Progress`, sub-issues **sized to one PR**, and continuous
deploy — anti-drag pressure applied at the work slice, not a calendar boundary a
tiny team can't make hard anyway.

**Why this phase picks milestones:** early development is **discovery-driven** —
you're figuring out scope as you go, capacity is erratic, and the priority is
shipping the *right* thing, not a predictable amount. Iterations shine in the
opposite regime (a known backlog, steady team, predictable capacity metered at a
constant clip) — steady-state maturity, not pre-launch. (Honest counter:
time-boxing can curb rabbit-holing during discovery — but the Lean answer is
build-measure-learn, get it in front of a user fast, for which the clock is your
**deploy cadence**, not a two-week sprint; and a WIP limit plus one-PR slices curb
it at the work level more directly. You already have those.)

**Iterations also don't fit the agent queue.** Agents run when triggered, not "this
week"; scoping the queue to `iteration:@current` adds nothing over *agent-set +
Ready + priority*. Iteration is a human-cadence concept your agents don't have.
(The native Iteration field stays available if you reach steady-state and want it.)

## Hierarchy (sub-issues, not Epics)

There's **no Epic type, by design.** The "big initiative" role splits cleanly
into two natives — **sub-issues** carry the *hierarchy* axis and **milestones**
carry the *delivery-batch* axis — and GitHub stitches them together for you: a
**sub-issue inherits its parent's Project and Milestone by default** (shipped
2025-09). Assign them once on the parent and the child tree picks them up — no
per-child bookkeeping.

So a parent issue "Scheduling v1" in milestone `v1.1.0` pulls its whole subtree
into that release payload for free. Break big work down with **sub-issues** (up to
8 levels — flip on **Show hierarchy** in a view to expand/collapse the tree)
rather than a markdown checklist or an Epic type: you get the structure without
the "Feature or Epic?" tax.

**Sub-issues are your only hierarchy axis; everything else stays flat.** Type,
Status, milestone, labels, and fields must never try to encode "part of" — that's
the sub-issue's job, and only that. Once that's clear, the rest is just sizing and
deciding what metadata rides on the parent vs. the leaves.

**The three-tier shape (replaces Epic → Story → Task with natives):** a
**milestone** (the cross-feature shippable batch — possibly-unrelated work)
contains parent
**Feature** issues (each a cohesive capability), each of which contains **Task**
sub-issues (mergeable slices). Full hierarchy, no synthetic Epic.

The boundary that trips people up: **a milestone is a flat batch of unrelated
features targeting one delivery outcome; a parent issue is one cohesive thing
decomposed.** So
don't build a giant "Launch" parent with 40 sub-issues spanning unrelated features
— that's exactly what the milestone is for. Milestone for the cross-feature
batch; the parent-issue tree for a single feature.

**Where metadata lives — parent vs. leaf.** The **parent** holds the durable
context: the spec (your Given/When/Then acceptance criteria), the "why," the
explicit *not*-doing reasoning, and — since sub-issues auto-inherit it — the
**milestone and project** assignment. Set those once on the parent and the tree
inherits; move the parent to `v1.1.0` and the whole tree moves with it. Never set
the milestone per child.

The **leaves** hold execution: the `Task` type and the **`Size` points**. Put
the estimate on the mergeable one-PR slices, not the parent — estimating a slice is
reliable, estimating a big parent isn't — and a view's field sums total the leaves
for you.
It's route-not-duplicate applied to hierarchy: a child references the parent's spec
rather than restating it, and reads up for context.

**Sub-issue vs. task-list checkbox.** Markdown `- [ ]` task lists still have a
place. The rule: if an item needs its own **status, assignee, or independent
scheduling**, promote it to a **sub-issue**; if it's just "steps to finish this one
issue," leave it a **checkbox** in the body. Don't promote every checkbox (that's
sprawl), and don't spin up a sub-issue where a checkbox suffices.

**Research child as a blocking gate.** When a Feature has an unknown, spawn a
**Research** sub-issue and let it *block* the implementation children. It closes
when it produces a decision record (the Research closure rule), which unblocks the
rest — encoding "figure this out first, then build" in the tree itself, and tying
Research, sub-issues, and the ADR discipline together.

**Hierarchy is not dependency.** A sub-issue means *"part of,"* not *"must happen
before."* If A must finish before B but B isn't part of A, that's a **dependency**
— the native blocked-by relationship, or the `blocked` label + a note (see
**Blocked is not a status** above) — not a parent-child link. Conflating them
corrupts the tree; keep composition (sub-issues) and sequencing (dependencies) in
separate mechanisms.

## Cross-repo work

The one board already spans every repo (the single default project per owner). For
work that *itself* crosses repos, reach for the tree, not a new field:

**A cross-repo feature → a parent sub-issue tree. No field needed.** A feature that
touches app + infra + marketing is one cohesive thing, so it's a legitimate parent:
the parent **Feature** issue lives in the app repo, its **Task** children live in
whichever repos they belong to (sub-issues cross repos freely), and the parent's
rollup counts completion across all of them. The tree *is* the cross-repo grouping
— you track it by opening the parent, not by tagging a field.

**A cross-repo *release* is mostly a smell.** Repos with genuinely independent
deploy cadences shouldn't share a release: the app cuts versions via release-please
on its own rhythm, an Astro marketing site deploys continuously on copy changes,
infra changes when infra changes. Forcing "app v1.1.0 + a pricing-page edit + a
terraform tweak" into one dated cross-repo release invents coordination the
independent cadences don't need. What legitimately spans repos is **features, not
releases** — so the flat cross-repo batch a milestone structurally can't hold (and
that a field would exist to solve) mostly shouldn't exist.

**The one genuine exception: a coordinated launch.** An initial public launch
really does need app-live + marketing-up + infra-provisioned at once — a real
cross-repo dated batch. Even then, model it as a single **Public Launch** parent
tracking issue with cross-repo sub-issues, not a new field: it's a one-time event,
not a recurring dimension worth a permanent field on every issue forever.

## Views

Views (the board's tabs) **can't be created via API** — Projects V2 exposes no
view mutations, only reads — so create these once in the UI (**Project → New
view**). Keep the saved set small; **slice the one board** (below) for the rest.

- **Board** — board, `is:open`, grouped by `Status`. The day-to-day working board.
- **Triage** — table, filtered to items **missing a `Priority`** or carrying
  **`needs-triage`**, grouped by **Type** (Bug / Feature / Task / Research) so you
  see the shape of the inbox. This is your grooming session — it exists so
  untriaged work can't hide; empty it regularly and it stays useful.
- **Agent queue** — board, filtered to issues carrying a **`suggest:*`** label
  (Projects label filters match **concrete** values, not prefixes — enumerate
  the seeded family labels in the filter, and extend it when the registry
  gains a family), showing only the in-flight `Status` columns (**Ready, Agent
  Queue, In Progress, Verifying, In Review, Ready to Merge**), sorted by
  `Priority`.
- **Planning** — table, grouped by **`Product`** (or `Type`), sorted by
  `Priority`, with the **`Size` field summed in each group header**. The "how
  big is the pile, and what's the plan" view, and a **dates-free roadmap
  substitute**: the per-group sum shows the weight behind each product without
  maintaining a timeline. (`Size` is a **number** field — GitHub sums number
  fields in group headers, so this totals the points behind each group; a
  single-select can't be summed.)
- **Mine** — table, `is:open assignee:@me`, sorted by `Priority`.

### Two toggles, not more views

- **Show hierarchy** (sub-issues — public preview) — expands/collapses sub-issues
  up to 8 levels while still grouping, slicing, sorting, and filtering. Flip it on
  in the Board or Planning view for the parent-with-children rollup you'd
  otherwise reach for an Epic type to get — the payoff of choosing **sub-issues
  over Epics**: structure without the "Feature or Epic?" tax. Still preview, so
  expect rough edges.
- **Slice the board** — rather than a separate saved view per product, slice
  the one board by **`Product`** (still a field, so a view can group by it).
  One board, many lenses — how multiple products stay legible in one
  aggregating project instead of fragmenting into project-per-product. Domain
  and Layer are labels only (harmon-init#875): a view can still **filter** on
  `domain:*`/`layer:*` (add the label to the view's filter), it just cannot
  **group** by them the way a field allows — same as the agent split, which is
  a label question too (`suggest:*`/`claim:*` — filter, don't slice).

## Notes

- **Labels vs Type** — `Type` is a first-class, org-level issue field
  (Bug / Feature / Task / Research), separate from labels (see **Labels** above);
  don't reproduce it as a label.
- **Owner**, **Iteration/cycle** — additional fields/axes as the work needs them
  (**Milestones** have their own section above).
- An issue can belong to **multiple projects** — the org project plus a focused
  one is fine.
