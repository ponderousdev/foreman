# check-bot-gh-identity.sh — the BOT profile's gh-identity tripwire
# (harmon-init#1236).
#
# The git-identity assertions in scripts/devcontainer-assert.sh prove who this
# container COMMITS as; nothing proved who `gh` WRITES as. When the bot PAT
# never arrives, `gh` comes up unauthenticated and its own output suggests
# `gh auth login` — and an operator (or an agent relaying that suggestion) can
# interactively authenticate a personal account, after which every issue, PR,
# and comment is attributed to the human and a personal credential sits inside
# a bypassPermissions agent container.
#
# The PAT is PROVISIONED, never hand-authored: on Coder it flows template
# parameter -> workspace host env -> init-env.sh -> .devcontainer/
# devcontainer.env -> the container's GH_TOKEN; on other hosts the same
# init-env.sh projection runs from whatever the host env exports. So every
# remedy below points at that chain — this check is defense-in-depth for a
# provisioning failure upstream of this repo, and the one thing it must never
# do is suggest an interactive login.
#
# Decides from `gh auth status` output ALONE — no extra API call: the
# stored-credential shapes name their account even when validation fails
# (offline or revoked). Two shapes cannot be resolved locally and are
# indeterminate, never violations: a token from the environment that gh could
# not validate (it names no account), and gh missing entirely. Like the
# sibling git checks, this asserts the RELATIONSHIP (a '-bot' login suffix),
# never a literal account name, so the script stays valid verbatim in
# generated projects.
#
# Exit codes (consumers map them; this script only reports):
#   0  every gh credential names a '-bot' account
#   1  VIOLATION — a credential names a non-bot account (loud warning)
#   2  unauthenticated — no credential at all (loud provisioning remedy)
#   3  indeterminate — gh missing, or an environment token that cannot be
#      validated right now (offline / rate-limited / expired); the ACTIVE
#      identity is then unknown even when stored bot logins are also present,
#      because gh prefers the environment token for writes
#
# Callers: .devcontainer/post-start.sh (warn-only, `|| true`, into the
# post-start log), scripts/status.sh's creds section (the VISIBLE surface —
# the session-start hook renders it; gated there to the bot profile), and
# scripts/devcontainer-assert.sh container mode (fails on exit 1 only).
