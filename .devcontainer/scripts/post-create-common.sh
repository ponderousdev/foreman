# stop (docs/architecture/security.md). Each profile's own post-create.sh

# --- Transitional: Codex overridable-defaults layer (harmon-init#1186) ---

# Model, reasoning effort, the project-doc budget and the TUI status line moved
# OUT of /etc/codex/managed_config.toml, where Codex treats every key as an
# unoverridable requirement that silently beats `-c` and the user's own config,
# and INTO /etc/codex/config.toml, its system *defaults* layer. (An explicit
# `-m` still overrode a pinned `model`; it was `-c model=` that was swallowed.)
#
# The installer that writes that file lives in the shared IMAGE, but this repo
# pins an image by digest, so between this change landing and the consumer-pin
# bump the pinned image still ships the old installer -- it would create no
# /etc/codex/config.toml at all, and the defaults would simply vanish rather
# than become overridable. This step closes that window from the consumer side.
#
# It is deliberately self-retiring: once the pinned image's own installer
# writes the file, the `-f` test is true on every subsequent build and this is
# a no-op. Delete it after the pin bump has landed everywhere.
# `workspace_root` is local to reconcile_workspace_permissions, so resolve it
