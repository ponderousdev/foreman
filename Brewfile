# Brewfile for Foreman
# Install with: task install  (brew bundle --file=Brewfile)
#
# Base-OS prerequisite, deliberately not a brew entry: `file(1)`, which
# scripts/lint-hygiene.sh requires. macOS ships /usr/bin/file and every
# mainstream Linux distro installs it in the base system, so a brew formula
# would shadow the system binary to no benefit. CI provisions it explicitly via
# scripts/ensure-file.sh; if it is somehow absent locally, lint-hygiene.sh says
# so by name and exits rather than misreporting binaries as text.

# lint-hygiene.sh parses .foreman.toml with bare `python3` + tomllib (>= 3.11);
# stock macOS ships 3.9 and uv provides no `python3` shim, so the interpreter
# itself is still a dependency.

# Skills sync (scripts/sync-skills.sh reads .skills-sync.yaml)
brew "yq"

# Utilities
# coreutils provides `timeout`, which stock macOS lacks — scripts/status.sh
# bounds its network probes with it.

# Cask = macOS only; on Linux/devcontainers install with

# on Linux before any of the remaining deps install).
cask "codex" if OS.mac?
