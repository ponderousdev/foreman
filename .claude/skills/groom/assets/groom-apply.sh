#!/usr/bin/env bash
# groom-apply.sh — the groom skill's write path for everything triage-apply.sh
# and check-issue-metadata.sh do not already cover: closing issues, retitling
# (guarded by check-issue-metadata.sh --title-only --previous-title),
# assigning an existing milestone, and linking an existing sub-issue. Label
# writes are delegated to triage-apply.sh so classification metadata has
# exactly one write path repo-wide.
#
# Dry-run is the DEFAULT: every op prints "PLAN <exact gh command>" and writes
# nothing. --execute additionally requires GROOM_EXECUTE=1 in the environment
# (set only by the `task groom` wrapper for a supervised run) — a model cannot
# promote itself to write mode by adding a flag alone (same contract as
# triage-apply.sh's TRIAGE_EXECUTE gate).
#
# Bot-owned issues (author type Bot, or login matching app/* or *[bot]) are
# NEVER retitled, closed, or relabelled by this script — it refuses, naming
# the issue, whatever the plan row says (issue #1015 criterion 6). A plan row
# may carry its own "bot_owned" field (populated by groom-verdicts.sh's join
# from the scan); --execute additionally re-checks the issue's live author
# immediately before writing, since the plan may be stale by apply time.
#
# apply-plan runs in TWO PASSES (challenge round 1 finding 5). Pass 0 refuses
# a plan carrying two rows for the same op+issue outright (challenge round 2
# finding 4 — a plan-authoring duplicate/leftover, e.g. two retitles for the
# same issue, must never resolve to "whichever pass 2 happens to apply last").
# Pass 1 then validates every remaining row — op recognized, required fields
# present, close reason valid, plan-carried bot_owned, a label op's full
# never-list/allowlist/axis/repo-kind validation via triage-apply.sh's own
# dry run (challenge round 2 finding 3 — validate_label used to check only
# bot ownership, so a label pass-1 accepted could still be refused for real
# in pass 2, after earlier rows in the same plan had already been written),
# and in --execute mode the live bot re-check — and performs no writes at
# all. Only once every row in the plan has validated does pass 2 run,
# applying (or, in dry-run, PLAN-printing) each write in order. A row that
# fails validation therefore aborts before ANY row has been written, instead
# of leaving the earlier rows in the plan already applied.
#
# A retitle's live-title re-check (finding 6: the issue's current title must
# still match the plan's previous_title, or the retitle is refused rather
# than silently overwriting a concurrent edit) runs in BOTH pass 1 and pass 2
# in --execute mode (challenge round 2 finding 4 — pass 1's own validation
# loop can itself take long enough, across every other row's live checks,
# for a concurrent edit to land in the gap before pass 2 writes; re-checking
# immediately adjacent to the write closes that window). A pass-2 refusal is
# reported as a conflict naming the plan-file row number — pass 1 already
# accepted the plan, so this is new information for whoever is watching the
# run, not a validation gap — and the run stops with whatever pass 2 already
# wrote recorded in the log.
#
# The write log (--log) is opened in APPEND mode with a
# "# run <UTC timestamp> apply" header line for every --execute invocation —
# it is never truncated, so a rerun after a partial failure keeps the record
# of what an earlier attempt already wrote. Each WRITE line is the EXACT
# command: log_write serializes every argv element with `printf '%q'`
# (bash 3.2 supports it) instead of flattening the array with "$*", which
# lost argv boundaries whenever an approved title, comment, or milestone name
# contained whitespace, quotes, or shell metacharacters (Codex review on
# PR #1032, comment 4012242585).
#
# --outcomes FILE (optional) appends one JSON Lines record per applied write —
# {"issue":N,"op":"close|retitle|label|milestone-assign|sub-issue-link",
#  "status":"DONE","at":"<UTC>"} (sub-issue-link records against the CHILD
# issue number) — for groom-report.sh render --outcomes to merge into each
# row's `status` column (issue #1015 finding 8). Dry-run never writes to it.
# In --execute mode pass 1 verifies the sink is appendable (same as --log);
# once writes are underway, a write_outcome failure warns and continues
# rather than aborting the run under set -e (challenge round 2 finding 8 —
# the outcome record is a convenience for the report, not itself a write
# whose loss should strand a plan partway through).
#
# Usage:
#   groom-apply.sh apply-plan --repo owner/repo --plan-file PATH --log PATH
#                  [--max-closes N] [--outcomes PATH] [--execute]
#
# Plan file: JSON Lines, one op per line:
#   {"op":"close","issue":N,"reason":"completed|not planned|duplicate","comment":"...","bot_owned":false,"unticked":false}
#   {"op":"retitle","issue":N,"title":"...","previous_title":"...","preserve_original":true,"bot_owned":false}
#   {"op":"label","issue":N,"add":["..."],"remove":["needs-triage"],"bot_owned":false}
#   {"op":"milestone-assign","issue":N,"milestone_title":"...","bot_owned":false}
#   {"op":"sub-issue-link","parent":N,"child":N}
#
# A "close" row's optional "unticked" field is a plan-authoring hint only
# (surfaced as a dry-run NOTE); the real gate is the live-body re-check below,
# which runs only in --execute mode.
#
# A "retitle" row gains an optional field: preserve_original: true. A retitle
# loses wording when the new title does not contain the previous title's
# outcome verbatim (detected via issue-title.jq's issue_title_outcome helper).
# In execute mode, pass 1 refuses (exit 4) any retitle that loses wording on an
# empty-body issue unless preserve_original is true. In pass 2, when
# preserve_original is true and wording is lost, after the title write succeeds
# a marked section ("## Original title\n<!-- groom-original-title -->\n<previous_title, verbatim>")
# is appended to the body via `gh issue edit N --repo R --body-file -` on stdin.
# The body append is idempotent: if the live body already carries the marker,
# the append is skipped and noted on stdout. If preserve_original is set but no
# wording is lost, nothing is appended and a NOTE is printed. In dry-run mode,
# a second PLAN line is printed for the body append whenever execute mode would
# append. The body append logs its own WRITE line and records a write_outcome
# with op "retitle-preserve".
#
# Exit: 0 = dry-run resolved or every write applied, 1 = a write failed,
#       2 = usage/environment error (including --execute without the env gate,
#       more "close" rows than --max-closes allows, an unwritable --outcomes
#       sink in --execute mode, two plan rows naming the same op+issue, a
#       "duplicate" close whose comment does not name a distinct canonical
